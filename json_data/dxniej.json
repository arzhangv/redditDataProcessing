Being curious I immensely went to search online what it does but most of the stuff I found is just people explaining how you get it, how to get rid of it and saying very vaguely that it \"enables the attacker to do a multitude of malicious things to your computer from inside\".\n\nAs the title says, I want to know *exactly* what that multitude of things are. Not necessarily every single thing, just how dangerous that specific Trojan is and how much damage could have already been caused by it being undetected for over a month of having the software installed and how much damage it can cause if I don't get rid of it and the software. (I already uninstalled and deleted any files connected I could find but I want to know in the future if the same thing happens)\n\nThanks in advance",

Infection starts with PUA (some inauthentic/bundled VLC/WinRAR/Chrome, etc installer) and Tiggre shows up a little later after persistence is gained.\n\nThe PUA typically brings with it some .dat files that aren't detected because they're truncated, but the PUA executable runs cmd.exe with command-line to combine the .dat files into a new executable (thus evading download protection/file scans) then self-deletes while the new executable remains and adds itself to ASEP registry, etc.\n\nVery low-tech but end users keep falling for junk versions of popular apps, so it keeps working.",

These kinds of malware all share somewhat common, generic behaviors but those behaviors manifest in a lot of different ways. So if you map out a kill chain for a novice, it probably won't help much because the next instance of the same/similar threat will be using different filenames/registry key names, C2 IP/domain, etc.  That's my 2 cents, anyway.  It's probably why most malware signatures/definitions in malware encyclopedias don't bother detailing the activity, either.",
