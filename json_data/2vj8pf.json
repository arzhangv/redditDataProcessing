        "selftext": "So two days ago, my mom got a brand new laptop, an upgrade from her crappy HP Pavilion. So to whom was the HP laptop given? None other than my 9 year old little brother, of course! As you could easily guess, he knows NOTHING about computers and trusts everyone and every link. He's really big into Minecraft, and wanted to mod on the Xbox version. He downloaded the program \"Horizons\" without doing a simple Google search as to the safeness of the program. If he did, he'd have seen 50 pages saying that this was, in fact, a virus. He got a virus within the first 10 MINUTES of having the damn thing! His computer wouldn't even turn on after that. We actually got it on after a day of trying, and my sister and I uninstalled the program, along with the search engine, \"bikiniisland.com\", downloaded Malwarebytes, and saved the pc. A lesson was learned, however and it doesn't look like he'll be modding any time soon. There's our story. xD",
