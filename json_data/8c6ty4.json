I forgot my password so i requested a SMS code. Heres where im freaking out. My phone automatically entered the code BEFORE i got the SMS. not only this, but it kept spamming the same code (e.g 12345) every second. 12345, 12345, 12345 and my facebook app kept flashing it was the wrong code. Please tell me if this is normal or not. Please explain? im seriously losing it since i clicked that link. Anti malware showed as nothing. \n\n\nALSO: the link was from a website called storage.googleapis.com\ncan someone please tell me what that is.",
