Some malware strains won't even install on computers with a Cyrillic keyboard installed.\n\nMore to your question, the style of the code wouldn't tell you anything because once it's a binary, the compiler has made so many optimizations it shouldn't be recognizable. On top of that, tracing the asm is usually much more interesting than anything \"stylistic\". \n\nFor me personally, I'm always annoyed by Golang specifically because of how easy it is to strip symbols and you wind up with 100-1000 unnamed functions.",
