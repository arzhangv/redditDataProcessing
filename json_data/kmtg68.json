Does anyone have an recommendations for free/open source solutions to transfer potentially malicious from the honey pot to my lab environment?   \n\n\nObviously trying to avoid any direct network connections. Was thinking of using a cloud storage like google drive but wanted to see if there were better options available / what people recommend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly any recommendations on setting up a malware honey pot would be greatly appreciated!!",
