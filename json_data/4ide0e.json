What methods do security companies use to find new potentially malicious software, and is there any way for me to emulate those methods?\n\nFrom what I understand some email providers execute email attachments in a sandbox to analyze them and other organizations run honeypots to detect worms.  I'm setting up a Dionaea honeypot now, but I'm interested in using whatever other methods there are available to \"catch\" new viruses.  Are there any other methods of finding out that there is a new virus out there and getting your hands on a definite sample?\n\nI know that there are certain sites I could go to to download already known malware, but I'm particularly interested in finding new stuff.  I just think it would be far more interesting to unpack the latest botnet than it would be to analyze year-old adware.",
