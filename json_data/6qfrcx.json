Check creation dates in ~/Library/Safari/Extensions to see when it was created. Check for Mac Startups items as well to find any app installed in X most recent days. Usually a combination of those two. \n\nIf it's an extension, use xar to extract out the contents and you can likely find the downloader code within one of the js/*.js files (safari-browser.js), etc.\n\n",
