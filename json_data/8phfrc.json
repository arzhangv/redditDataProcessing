After some quick tests in various\nvirtual machines I was surprised, that this is not necessary in most\ncases. Even the Avast pre-boot scan didn't find the virus.\n\n11 / 60 virus total's scanners recognized the trojan. It was a free, public\ntrial version! No modifications! All 11 hits were \"generic\". One of those\nmalware programmers offers all surveillance methods you can think of, but\nnot keylogger. To avoid Antivirus detection.\n\nShort question: what's the easiest way to find those malware?\nMalwarebytes, for example, says they had proprietary methods that were\nbetter than the other scanners, but at least in the affected, running\nwindows, they didn't find more of those viruses.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nChris",

One in particular would do the whole gamut, keylogging, scheduled screenshots, along with tracking applications and how much time is spent 'idle'. Typically used in law offices.\n\nThere's not a lot surprising going on under the hood. It runs as a service, even as a local admin it is really difficult to break the software, because if the client misses a checkin and the server can hit it on the network as NETWORK SERVICE, it'll just push the software down again and you're back up and monitoring in under a minute. It doesn't work like a virus because it isn't, it installs through typical methods, uses the readily available Win32 API, and there's very little reason for AV companies to wade into that swamp, because they don't get deployed unless it's authorized by a sysadmin, and if the AV is a snitch, the company will find one that isn't.",

Then, find out what setting(s) need to be enabled to detect them, and make sure those settings are enabled in your copy of the software.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky\n",
