I just like to chime in when I see a post that's been downvoted many times, but nobody has outright explained WHY it's downvoted when it's just because this isn't the place to ask to remove malware or in your case, potentially unwanted programs (often except for the ones when people with questionable motives ask something that doesn't appear aboveboard). Especially now that I cannot see the stupid sidebar, so I'm not sure if others can see it either. \n\nThe mods added a sticky to the top of the sub, but it's easy to miss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",
