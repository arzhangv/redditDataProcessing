I'm currently looking into ways of falsifying scheduled task legitimacy, for educational/PoC purposes of course\n\nDLL dropins and DLL hijacking are two other methods of exploitation that can result in compromising admin, but I can't think of any particular malware samples that use these techniques off the top of my head\n\nNote: I take no responsibility for any illegal or otherwise unethical usage of what I linked to",
