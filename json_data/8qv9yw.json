It got automatically / forcefully downloaded via Google Chrome on visiting some site ( not sketchy or porn ). Thankfully Avast detected it. \n\nBtw, recently I even saw google ads of MacKeeper on YouTube ( Adblock was disabled ) . They have very poor ad quality management if adwares can advertised like that.\n\n",
