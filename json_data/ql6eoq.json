I used those variants to find a family tree for them.",

I fixed computers from hardware problems like a dead CPU or RAM. The types of things I've seen are like... Nanocore, Search Protect, Conduit toolbar, fake antiviruses and whatnot... you know? Nothing crazy. This is all such a different game than what I saw at the shop. Its own class entirely - when  I was fixing computers ZBot was the scary one, now it seems pretty rare. \n\nI didn't know Tsunami uses it too... I have been looking at Trick and trying to find more info about Formbook recently, since they are most popular on any.run. What do you think of those?",
