After trying to figure out why this was, I noticed when I typed my email address on my email was kind of substituted for a different email entirely. So whatever I was sending was going somewhere else. About 10 minutes later I got all those emails I sent, sent back to me by the email that they were sent to.\n\nThis was the body. \n\nOn 1/11/11 00:00 AM, a puzzled user wrote:\n\n&gt; Why has my email been rejected \n\nBecasuse it was sent it to xmca-l@ucsd.edu\n\n&gt;and what does that mean\n\nSomehow the address xmca-l@ucsd.edu was either added to or substituted\nfor the intended recipient's address - perhaps through an email virus.\n\n\n&gt; has my email actually been received by the recipient?\n\nI have no way of knowing.\n\nIf it's any comfort, you are one of a huge group of people who have\nthis problem, and who write to me (often using gross profanity) about\nthe rejection.\n\nI wish I knew what was causing this, but I don't.\n\nGood luck.  \n\nAnyone know what I can do about this?",
