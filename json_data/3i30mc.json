Malware got in while i was using safe mode to try and fix the computer after a Microsoft update broke a Server Service dependency...which rendered chrome broken, even in safe mode.  Decided to use the internet explorer because what harm could happen in the day or two it took to fix...well this much harm can.\n\nFigure I will go with nuke it from orbit since the only things on it are save games and photos.
