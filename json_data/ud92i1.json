Its seems to want to be sure and thats the problem.\n\nMaybe you are not satisfied with this answer and i am sorry but id rather tell people to be careful and consider this a threat rather than telling people its safe and getting in infected.

I saw on VT that the files are contacting one domain outside, so I blocked all inbound and outbound connections using firewall.\n5. I checked the 'dropped files' when I ran those cracks on VT and Hybrid-Analysis. All files seemed ok, what the non crack version would drop.\n6.

Antiviruses are giving informations, not answers.\n\nYou need to know some things : \n\n\n1) AVs can be right or wrong. False positive, False negative, etc.. In the end, YOU DECIDE. \n\n2) Viruses actions can be stealth and delayed.\n\n3) There is NO WAY to tell if file is 100% safe without checking it properly and manually. Therefore as specialists they CANT TELL YOU its safe that would be unprofessional and dangerous. \n\nWhat do we have here?

A known malware/virus can be trivially altered and avoid the signature.  There are also methods of obfuscation that range from trivial (base64) to complicated (full encryption, split payload, etc) to avoid known signatures.  There are also malware/virus types that can detect a known sandbox (control VM that prevents malware/virus from escaping) condition and will not unload the package if they detect a sandbox.  The malware/virus would then work quite well on a regular system.\n\nYou're getting good advice.  What you are considering doing, to save some money, is very risky.  If you really do have financial information and credentials on your systems, I strong advise, with sincere concern, that you not run the executable on your personal systems.\n\nThis advice could be entirely incorrect.\n\nBut I doubt it.",

Block outbound traffic from the host server.  Have a way to watch for packets from the host server and VM.  Or just put it all on another network that is connected to nothing, including the internet.  Though some malware will stay dormant until able to connect outbound.\n\nAdministratively deactivate the network interface on the VM, not within the OS, leave that on in case the payload is checking for network interfaces.  Run the .exe and see what happens and if a malware package detonates.  Do not assume all is well if you do not see anything immediately, some malware have a delay before becoming active.  You need to be able to watch for file changes on the VM and know how to investigate changes to those files, including when a file is added to, not just replacements, to know what is going on.
