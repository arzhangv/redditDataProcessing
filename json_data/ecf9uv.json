        "selftext": "Backstory: I recently found out that one of my friends used some malware ([DiscordSpyTool.exe](https://app.any.run/tasks/c3072a45-2e43-4808-8f56-a542bc8a73c7/)) to spy on another friend's Discord DMs for a period of months. Full story [here](https://loomermisc.s3.amazonaws.com/kolyas_discord_hack.pdf) if interested (popcorn not included).\n\nThe attacker still denies everything, and recently produced what he says is the original (supposedly non-malicious) executable he sent the victim. It still sets off a ton of malware warnings, but I'm having trouble discerning what it actually does. I haven't run it locally, just uploaded it to Hybrid Analysis [here](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/950fb2e004b551cf312f4547365941a94dc9126db5a5400730aa313e4ed8258c/5df9aebd8b7c9a3ac20cdfe7). (Note, this 86 KB .exe is \\*supposed\\* to be \"some graphic assets in Unreal 4\" according to the attacker \ud83d\ude44)\n\nSeems like it might just do a bunch of potentially malicious actions and then display a (hard-coded?) error message? Is that right to say? Any insight analyzing this would be greatly appreciated. I also have the actual .exe file of course if that would be OK to post a link to in this subreddit (erring on the side of caution first though).",
