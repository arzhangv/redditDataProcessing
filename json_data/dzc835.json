I was stupid and ignored the warnings because I thought it was a false positive which have happened in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWindows Defender quarantined two files after I ran the exe.\n\n \n\n\tTrojan:Win32/Conteban.B!ml \n\n\tTrojan:Win32/Suloc.l!cl \n\nI have removed those files and further scans with windefender and malwarebytes premium doesn't show any malicious files on my system, so I think/hope I'm good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried searching for info on google, and I think these might be ransomware but I don't know for sure.\n\nI uploaded the whole zip file to VirusTotal and I got this result: [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/66b8b7f71492853cbf34e4ee0d178d6bacff247e1835035817cb40d384b130f3/detection](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/66b8b7f71492853cbf34e4ee0d178d6bacff247e1835035817cb40d384b130f3/detection)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any malware/virus pros here that can give me some further info on these files?\n\nAnd do you think I'm safe now or should I reinstall windows from scratch?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",
