Take for example a product using OpenSSL... Does just notifying the product manufacturer make it non-zero day?  Do you have to notify the developers of OpenSSL?    \n\n\nIs it non-zero day if I notify others special hacking groups that have agreements to exchange exploits and vulnerabilities?  What if it's not an official report to the manufacturer, but I'm working with someone who works there?  \n\n\nI'd say if there isn't a public CVE, it's ZERO day.",

The people that would have an interest and ability to patch know about it but have accepted the risk at the request of the gov. It looses all impact if we call every bug a 0day. It's like giving every single release a major number. Or calling everyone you disagree with Hitler. It becomes meaningless. It's hard enough to get executives to pay attention without having to filter marketing and glory hounds trying to make something bigger than it is.",
