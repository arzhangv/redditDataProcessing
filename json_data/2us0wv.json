Then I start seeing obnoxious ads in YouTube, with a little message under it that says Worldwide Coupon. \n\nThis thing is pretty nasty. I tried to do a Google search about it and it hijacked a lot of the links. Tried to get Malwarebytes and it popped a realistic-looking warning saying it was a site known to have spyware.\n\nFinally got through to [a site](http://www.safebro.com/worldwide-coupon-virus-remove) and it made me realize it was a Chrome extension causing it. Removed it and restarted the browser and all seems well. Was able to go get Malwarebytes.\n\nMy question though: How was it able to install itself into Chrome? I am the sole user of this computer and I had no warning or any notice of this. I count myself as fairly savvy with the internets.\n\nI can only imagine how many users out there are stuck with this crippling piece of crap malware.",
