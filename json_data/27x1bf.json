I know carberp started using RC6 keys, but I've never actually understood how to extract it. Would it be similar to extracting the RC4 key from the binary?\n\nI know Xylitol and some others have already figured this out on kernelmode.info I understand the concept, but am not sure how to accomplish this task fully. \n\nI am pretty new to malware analysis, so any tips on this would be great.\n",
