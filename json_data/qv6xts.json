Make that a function, pass the variable you want to the function.\n* In get\\_timestamp() lines 25-30.  You already have a struct (lt), why would you break that out into variables?  Use the struct for what it's meant for.  Don't waste memory by mallocing more variables.\n* create\\_file().  Your signature is easily...signaturable?  It'd take a whole 30 seconds to create a YARA rule to detect it.  Try using some kind of obfuscation technique with a rolling key.\n* persist() and save\\_logs() Just make all the string concats one line.\n* Same advice for mouse\\_hook() and keyboard\\_hook() as above.  Use the struct, make smaller functions out of repeating logic.",
