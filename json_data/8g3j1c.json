What I did notice was a decent amount of ads being constantly loaded, which is why I recommended an ad blocker (I didn't see the same traffic when mine was on, only when I turned it off did I start getting more cpu usage). \n\nFrankly 53% for ads isn't the worst. You should've seen wowhead ~4 or 5 years ago. I used to accidentally leave it open while in game and I'd come back to it eating up around 80% of my cpu. I think for that case I decided it was a lot of flash based ads.",
