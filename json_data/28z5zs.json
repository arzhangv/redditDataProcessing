        "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI am currently trying to find employment as a Jr. Malware analyst. About half of the companies I would like to apply to mention the need for a security clearance, or the willingness to obtain one. \n\nThis is a problem for me as I am unable to obtain a clearance - my father is a high-level worker in the Iranian government. He is my father, so I do keep in contact with him and usually visit him in Iran once every couple of years. I was denied a clearance in the past for having regular contact with my father. \n\nAll this being said, do you think this will be a deal breaker for any kind of analyst position? A lot of the big companies do not make mention of the need for a security clearance - say, Kaspersky or Google - does that mean they won't ever ask for one?\n\nI really am interested in the subject and most likely will continue doing it as a hobby if I cannot find work in it, but it would be very disappointing to be denied the chance because of the whole security clearance thing.
