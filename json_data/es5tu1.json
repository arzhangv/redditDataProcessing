When I downloaded this on Ubuntu and extracted it using 7z, the properties mentioned that it was a Windows executable program. However, when I ran this on Windows 7 or Windows 10, it came up with that it is not a a valid Windows application. Would someone be able to take a look at this\n\n [https://github.com/fabrimagic72/malware-samples/tree/master/Ransomware/NotPetya](https://github.com/fabrimagic72/malware-samples/tree/master/Ransomware/NotPetya)",
