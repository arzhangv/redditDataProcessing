I'm currently using [**Bit Defender**](https://www.bitdefender.com/) and [**AiroAV**](https://www.airoav.com/) and quite happy with both.  But wondering if they are enough as there are so many types of [**malware**](https://medium.com/@AiroSecurity/airoav-is-shedding-some-light-on-a-malware-definitions-83a790c920e).  Also, is there a way on IOS (iPhone) to check certificates and also search text on websites?\n\n\u2014 A new form of Mac malware evades Apple's Gatekeeper program and hides from antivirus software. ADVICE: Run Mac antivirus software, since the malware won't run at all if it detects it on a machine.\n\n\u2014 An Instagram phishing campaign masquerades as a method by which your Instagram account can be receive a \"verified\" badge. But of course, you have to provide your email address and password. ADVICE: Check the URL of the website pretending to be Instagram; the real Instagram won't ask for your email address as verification.\n\n\u2014 The widely used video-playing software VLC got a hefty security update to thwart all sorts of exploits. ADVICE: Update your VLC software to version 3.0.7.",
