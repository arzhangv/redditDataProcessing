And then when attacker mixes indicators of cleanliness into their malware, they can evade naive ML approach.\n\nCylance does not exactly have a sterling reputation in the industry to begin with. \n\n[https://www.snapmunk.com/cyber-security-cylance-cotroversy-fraud-layoffs/](https://www.snapmunk.com/cyber-security-cylance-cotroversy-fraud-layoffs/) \n\nGoogle Cylance controvercy and you find also other cases.",
