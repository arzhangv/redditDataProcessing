Why can't a virus just be downloaded eg from an email attachment and execute without vulnerabilities? Or is that possible?",

            "comment": "I would put it this way. Vulnerabilities can give the malware access to something that is not available for the victim who executed the malware, such as, privileges like admin rights, access to other machines etc. So if the purpuse of the malware does not need such elevated access then no vulnerability is needed. For instance if the domain admin runs the malware then it can do anything anyway. But if a standard user runs it, then it might need to elevate privileges to be able to fulfill its purpuse.",
