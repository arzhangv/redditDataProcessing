It also depends on what you mean by \"tap.\" But to put it simply, for someone with the right resources it is not that difficult to compromise an iPhone or any other mobile device. If your threat model includes governments etc, you'd want to assume that your iPhone could be easily breached at any time. If not, then it is a reasonably secure device that should provide a good degree of confidentiality against most threats.",
