        "selftext": "Hi. Learning a bit more about malware, and I remember back in the day there were programs like EliteWrap that were \"exe wrapper's\" They would somehow embed executables inside of other files. I have been learning in class about droppers that either call out to the internet to download a file, or alternatively have embedded exes. Now, I suppose my question is, are wrappers being used to create these embedded exe's? By default, when using a wrapper program, is the embedded program ran when the other exe is ran?\n\nThanks.",
