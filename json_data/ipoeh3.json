Downloaded a .exe file from romsmania and stupidly ran it. \n\nIt installed a bootleg WinZip, so I ran a scan on malwarebytes and found a total of 218 threats. Damn.\n\nQuarantined em... Should I still be worried about anything?\n\nP.S: posting this so if others look it up on google they will see this thread. Ive seen so far that all the files end in a ton of numbers and the publisher starts randomly but ends in (Superior Media Ltd). If you're here from google immediately delete that file.",
