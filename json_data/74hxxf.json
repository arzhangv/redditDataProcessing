If it multiple its even better but it has to be from the same network.\n\nIf you have any question feel free to message me or post a comment below.\n\n",

I am looking for more specific data in .pcap or .snort format.\n\nSomething akin to the data provided here\nhttps://www.first.org/_assets/conf2015/networkforensics_virtualbox.zip\n\nBut already separated into normal traffic and malware traffic from the same network. \n\nI have an idea to propose to professor and i wanted to avoid as much manual labor since i just want to classify the traffic. \n\nThanks again for taking the time to reply.",
