And was slightly thrown of its trail because it had been updated like 2-3days ago. So it didn't show that it had been installed on the same day as the npcap (1 month ago) in revo uninstaller. I believe wireshark and Bitdefender home scanner go hand in hand. But just to confirm it, I uninstalled both and reinstalled the home scanner. Doing so reinstalled the npcap. So all should be fine. I'm a very paranoid person, and was about to do a clean install. Glad I didn't.  ",

If this is a work computer it may be something your security department installed. If its your home computer you should look at any other computers on your home network with this installed and consider the same treatment for them as well.\n",
