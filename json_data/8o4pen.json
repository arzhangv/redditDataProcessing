We've recently added a Pentesting section to our server. I decided to post an invite here because we want more people who are into technology \\(and more specifically pentesting\\) on the server.  This might sound very cluttered, but trust me, it's organized well. You won't see any channels about stuff that you aren't interested in.  Feel free to join us and hang around. Our community is pretty good.    \nThe invite link is Here   [https://discord.gg/47zcy94](https://discord.gg/47zcy94) ",
