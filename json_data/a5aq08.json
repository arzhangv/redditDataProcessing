I can\u00b4t understand anything because it is in chinese/japanese or some symbol language like that.\n\nI\u00b4ve gone to my task manager and this setup cames from a temp file and even deleting, it comes back everytime.\n\nThere\u00b4s any suspicious program on \"unninstal a program\" feature of windows, nor anything realted to 360 security at all.\n\nUsefull information:\nOS ---&gt; Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)",
