I am doing an investigation on APT 38 , and I would like to perform some malware analysis. However, from looking online, I have found it exceedingly difficult to find malware sample of APT 38. Does anyone have any samples I could use, know where i could get them, or could advise on the topic. I am earlyh to this, but i feel like i should get a decent number of samples for comparison. But considering I have found such difficulty with finding samples already, would it be worth looking at another APT group instead like 28 or 41? Any advice or answers is appreciated",

            "comment": " **Description**\n\nBluenoroff is a financially motivated threat actor which has close connection to the Lazarus APT group and has been attributed to major financial attacks in the past, including the Bangladesh Central Bank heist, South East Asian and African banks in 2016 and attacks against European and Taiwanese banks in 2017. This actor is believed to be nation state sponsored and its name comes from the file naming scheme they used. After the well-known huge major bank attack case, the threat actor targets not only banks, but casinos, fin-tech companies, ATM software in South Korea with ATM skimming malware and POS Software and Cryptocurrency businesses during 2018.\n\n#### Main activity\n\nBluenoroff\u2019s main focus has been financial gain, targeting various financial organizations, software developers for investment companies, crypto-currency businesses, and even casinos.\n\n* February 2016: The \u201cSWIFT bank heist\u201d resulted in the theft of over $81 mil of $951 attempted from the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Several other attacks took place in the same timeframe, which targeted at least one bank in Vietnam.\n* July 2016: A number of newer malicious tools resembling the activity of the SWIFT attacks were uploaded to VirusTotal from Bangladesh. Later on, some of these tools were discovered in a bank in Indonesia.\n* August 2016: Kaspersky Lab identified and blocked attempts to hack into a bank from Indonesia which carried the trademark of the \u201cSWIFT bank heist\u201d hackers from earlier this year. The attackers repeatedly tried to bypass the bank\u2019s defenses to run SWIFT data harvesting malware which bear strong resemblance to the tools used in the Vietnam case.\n* February 2017: Attack against financial institutions in Poland. The infection vector was a drive-by-download via a \u201cwatering hole\u201d attack in the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, and the Bluenoroff actor upgraded their arsenal.\n\n#### Main malware families used\n\n* SWIFT Tampering Malware. In order to gather SWIFT-related information, BlueNoroff uses several tools:\n* SWIFT information harvester: Processes the files given to it, parses them and searches for specific SWIFT message related strings. Its main purpose is to gather information about transactions, gathering information about the Sender and Receiver, Account and Statement Numbers, as well as some other data included in the parsed files.\n* SWIFT protection mangler: This module\u2019s main function is to patch SWIFT executables and libraries. The patches applied to the modules disable security checks and prevent the detection of any inconsistency.\n* SWIFT files hooking tool: This tool hooks specific windows APIs to execute malicious modules first. They also use a file patcher. The attackers use two different tactics in order to bypass the integrity checks implemented by SWIFT software: static file patching on disk and patching executables dynamically in memory.\n* Loader / Injector: A loader / injector to execute core malware such as backdoors.\n* Passive Backdoor: This module opens a TCP port and waits for incoming connections.\n* Active Backdoor: A backdoor with several capabilities (system information, execute commands, process tampering).\n* Ransomware-like wiper: When BlueNoroff attacked FEIB (Far Eastern International Bank) in Taiwan, they used a malware known as the Hermes ransomware. Usually ransomware encrypts document files and multi-media files, but the Hermes ransomware used in the Taiwan bank heist encrypts executable files as well and it didn\u00b4t leave any ransom note. It means that the actor used this ransomware with purely destructive intentions.\n* ATM Skimming malware Bluenoroff also targeted ATM S/W in South Korea. They created custom malware for specific modules developed by a Korean company developing PoS software. This malware is custom ATM skimming malware to hook legitimate software and steal card information",

            "comment": "It's the other way around. HIDDEN COBRA is by far the most broad of these, DHS clearly states that this is a designation for any DPRK-linked group in general.\n\nLazarus is a mish-mash of different operations loosely linked together mostly by malware overlap, clustered around the 2014 Sony incident and the lazarex@outlook email.\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/10/apt38-details-on-new-north-korean-regime-backed-threat-group.html points out that APT38 is a specific operation that shares some resourcing with the Lazarus stuff. It is highly specialized to do bank heists. The full report specifies Bluenoroff (Kaspersky) and Stardust Chollima (Crowdstrike) are equivalent tracked groups.\n\nFor OP, the fact that APT38 is so specific to targeting banks is really key to your analysis of this group. The tools they are using are chosen so they are harder to track, and the custom malware they use is designed to operate in the specific banking environments the group is targeting. APT38 is probably one of the best examples of a group tailoring its tools to a narrow set of targets and a specific way of operating. As mentioned in other posts here, looking at just the malware will not be enough and you need to understand the tools alongside their intended purpose and the intended target.",
