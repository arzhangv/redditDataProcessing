We can\u2019t find the fake one and there\u2019s only the real one left.\n\nWe changed the default engine back to chrome, use malwarebytes to scan, deleted all the files she downloaded recently, clean the trash and restarted her laptop at least 3 times. \n\nWhen we open a new tab, it doesn\u2019t open google but it shows a research engine that shows \u201csearch\u201d instead of google. We tried to delete it with all the advance settings and even try block the website, but it won\u2019t even let us enter the URL.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar situation? And does anyone know what to do with it? Thank you so much for responding :))",
