The web filter had default credentials. \n\n\n\n\nThis being a target rich environment, if anyone would like samples I'll upload some shortly.\n\n\n[NEW SAMPLE](https://www.sendspace.com/file/lgs8dw)  - Only a few AVs have picked up the file on VirusTotal.com\n\nNote: Sample ~~is missing~~ now includes generated exe",
