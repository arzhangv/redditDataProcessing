            "comment": "I looked at it ealriee and to be honest it didn't look like it was worth the money if your focused on Malware.\n\nIt's like they just thru in the word Hacker and tried to sell it. Most of it is kinda general security. The only thing that interests me in general sexuitty was the Cloud Security books in the $25 dollar bracket because I see many of our entities are using cloud providers more and more and it's not well targeted these days...but also may be because most of the security issues is like misconfigs of the IAM or ACLs. But I aint paying 25 for it when can access the PluralSight content via my company subscription or just watch con-talks ish from presenters that tend to be ahead of the cusp anyway",
