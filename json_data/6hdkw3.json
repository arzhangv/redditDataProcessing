The instance of the browser in the sandbox is totally separate and in fact, for example, if I change browser settings in the Sandboxie one, they are not reflected in the non-sandboxed one and never will be. In fact, I am well aware that any bookmarks I make in the sandbox stay there and ultimately will be lost. \n\nIf I need to go to a site I know is safe, I just do it in a browser outside Sandboxie.",
