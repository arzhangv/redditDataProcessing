This year I am building them a new pc and want to install a browser that will be safer for them. I know about sandboxie already, but what are some other options. (free or software for sale)  Ive seen browser in a box but  honestly, if it takes them over a minute to open their browser they simply won't use it.\nThey will be running windows 10. I would like the browser to be either Firefox or Chrome.\n",
