The website owners place ScorecardResearch web beacons into the pages of their website.\n\nWhen a browser loads a page that contains a ScorecardResearch web beacon, a cookie will be set. This, says comScore, allows it to observe \"browser-level\" behaviour, i.e. how often you return to a website or if, having visited one website, you go to another one that is related.\"\n\nSo Web beacons...",

            "comment": "Love it. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have a lot of time to play, but I have been using it for several years at home and it\u2019s very stable/reliable.  I also have a few corporate clients that we installed untangle for and it\u2019s been rock solid in a business environment for years.  A couple of them have been set up for years and have never called even once with a networking issue.  It seems to be extra efficient at routing large volumes of traffic - things just seem faster even with huge number of sessions going.  At one business it is used for public WiFi and is able to smoothly handle hundreds of clients simultaneously.  Of course, aside from stable/efficient routing, there\u2019s all the advanced features, add-on modules, controls and reporting that make it such a great product. ",
