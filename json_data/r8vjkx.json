Speaking from experience, if these files are written by you, it's better to learn how to rewrite your code to avoid false positives than to try to disable the detection, especially if you plan to distribute the code.\n\nIf this doesn't apply to you, or you just don't care, [this link](https://www.majorgeeks.com/content/page/how_to_manage_windows_defender_antivirus_found_threats.html) shows how to disable the specific detection on your machine.  It involves getting it detected, first, then browsing through a few menus to allow the threat.  I have done this in the past while testing exploit tools, so I know it works.",
