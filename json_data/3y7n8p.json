When I browse, I automatically get redirected to sites such as utrack, and other sites claiming to help you make millions.\n\nI have tried many software applications like malwarebytes, adw cleaner, junkware removal tool and ESET online scanner.\n\nNone of them have solved the issue. I have also tried resetting my browser to default settings many times with the issue not being resolved.\n\nI am using chrome but if I use another browser this issue persists.\n\nThis is not a problem with the router, I experienced it both at home and at University. Other PC's which use the same router as me are not having the problem.\n\nWhat can I do to solve this?\n\nI am using windows 8 OS and a Lenovo G50 laptop.  ",
