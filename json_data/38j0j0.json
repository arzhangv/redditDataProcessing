I'm using Procmon to get the length of the content in bytes and whatnot, but what tool would show me the content in plain text?\n\nFor example, a TCP client sends \"7:Win32:XP:Administrator\" to the server, and the server then replies \"thx\". I want to see the actual string sent by the client and received by the server. I'm doing analysis on a RAT, if it helps.\n\nI apologize for any spelling errors or bad English, I'm typing this on my phone in class.",
