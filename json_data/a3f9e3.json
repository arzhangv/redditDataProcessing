That doesn't mean they have your password or that they can login to your account, but it does mean they have your email and *might* have *a* password (your current or old password, depending). If you're pwned change your password. \n\nWhether you're pwned or not you should activate Multifactor Authentication (2FA or MFA) on all the services you can, and  get some sort of password storing app (1Password, LastPass, etc...). Use garbage passwords which you store in the app. The password \"padJSPOIH4584wef898##@FocsNf\" is functionally impossible to guess, even for a computer, and you'd just store it in your app so you don't need to remember it either.
