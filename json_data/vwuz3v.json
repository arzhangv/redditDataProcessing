He never clicks on any weird links and has two factor authentication enabled on both accounts. The hacker changed all the account details but luckily he was able to get at least his Steam account back already. I believe that he has some kind of malware/spyware on his pc that is stealing all of his data.  I adviced him to reset his pc and change all of his passwords, does anyone have any advice on what else to do? Or know what else could be the cause of the account takeovers? Thanks.",

And randomly generate your passwords, then store them into a password manager. Whatever is important back it up somewhere and make sure there is nothing infected in it. Might seem overkill, but if you ran a antivirus scan and nothing was found, this is really the only option.",

These malwares are usually encrypted and can't be found by most antivirus softwares. That's why I'm asking for advice, I've never dealt with this kind of malware before and it's so strange to me that the accounts were just taken over without any other sign.",
