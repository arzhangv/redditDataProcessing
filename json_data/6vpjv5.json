The JavaScript in the extension is [here](https://pastebin.com/q9urFHQu) and a lazy, shallow deobfuscation suggests it's going to make callouts to hxxp://jsdo[.]bid/avomazuzehisaj.json (edit: with a URL parameter which I'm yet to deobfuscate but is generated through a function so maybe dynamic) which in turn supplies the URL hxxp://jsdo].]bid/&lt;random_id&gt;.bg\n\nEDIT:\nOther domains hit in the process are what the link first resolves to:\nhxxps://drive[.]google[.]com/file/d/0B57QgBWLVO-WSFFDQWtkUUxkWjA/preview\n\nWhere clicking the video leads:\nhxxps://docs[.]mt2strom[.]com/video/profile.php?u=1073237158\n\nThe extension it triggers an installation request for:\nhxxps://chrome[.]google[.]com/webstore/detail/wiki-it/iclfdnhdchmifbokddeceofadeikmmai\n\nNote, this is all my experience and may vary between users.\n\nEDIT EDIT: Okay, deobfuscated by hand for practice and [this](https://pastebin.com/dcH1ZmYi) is all the array references swapped out for strings. This still contains a lot of junk code but is included here for completeness. I resolved every junk reference in case there was extra functionality pretending to be junk. TextEdit did some smartquote stuff, because it's a jerk, so this may not run.\n\n[This](https://pastebin.com/K50YQLAC) seems to be the relevant JS from this file which fetches the next stage by inserting a script element on the page with a src property of hxxp://jsdo[.]bid/&lt;GUID&gt;\n\n[This](https://pastebin.com/aMekEekw) is the second obfuscated stage.\n\nMORE EDITS:\n\n[This](https://pastebin.com/3EWgqKth) is the relevant parts of the second stage, which seems to call out to hxxp://jsdo.bid/sc.php, resolve that into a URL and call out to the URL, then execute the response to that inside each tab as it is updated. Also reads like it closes the tab if you open the Chrome extensions manager to try and remove it.\n",
