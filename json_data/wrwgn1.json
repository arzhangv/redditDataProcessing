You could just read the code and run it from the source code if you didn't trust the EXE.\n\nThe IP address is ... Microsoft. Sometimes the analysis service sees Windows connect to Microsoft servers for some scheduled reason. (And sometimes a bad actor buys an IP address on one of Microsoft's cloud services, but the connection doesn't show up consistently in the different Behaviour reports, and there's nothing in the source code that would explain it.) So everything after that is irrelevant.\n\nThe only other thing of note in the Behaviour report is keyboard or mouse hooking, which is totally explained by the entire purpose of the program.",
