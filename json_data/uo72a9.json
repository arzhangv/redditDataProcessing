Took the exams without using notes or references and got a 70 both times. Any recommendations before taking? Are the practice exams anything like the actual exam?  \nThanks",

(Don't trust or just use the ones in the book, those are not sufficient enough)",

            "comment": "Not sure if the test has changed much since last year but they definitely underemphasized the advanced binary RE stuff. They still had you recognize the PEB header usage (mov eax, fs:0x30) malicious SEH registration and triggering malicious handlers in assembly but other than that I should have focused more on JavaScript and other malware. That said I self-studied with no books and just took the practice exams before. Definitely a bit harder than the practice, so keep studying.",

In which I regret not starting to index/think about possible test questions until completion. So watch the video lessons, do the labs, then index things that happened in the chapter. Like definitions or tools, etc.\n\nOne thing that helped me the most was constructing run books on how to approach things as well.",
