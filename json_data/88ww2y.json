            "comment": "As others have mentioned, that cost is just for the exam without the discount for training. The price includes 2 practice exams that are just like the actual exam. The best way that I have found to use them are to take the first practice exam pretty quickly, see what areas you are weak in, and then go back and spend time preparing. use the second practice exam to confirm before taking the actual test.\n\nIn my opinion, if you have practical experience, day in and day out, for 2-3 years or more in a subject area then you should go ahead and just do the certification. However, if you have a good information security background and are looking to expand to new areas or do your current job better, the training is a great experience. I learned a lot in a course rather than just taking an exam. The course materials that you walk away with are purposefully not even close to the whole experience.",
