My Windows Defender goes crazy and I see something along the lines of Trojan.Win32/IRCBOT process: pid:5148,ProcessStart:132472926111962494. Once I run MalwareBytes, I do a quick scan and there will be a problem with something like the Registry Value/Key malware. After that I quarantine it and my apps like [battle.net](https://battle.net) start working again. But when I open Genshin Impact, the problem pops up again and I have to fish it out with MalwareBytes again. Everytime I restart my computer, it shows the IRCBot malware thing again.\n\nAny assistance would be much appreciated",

So, you can reinstall Windows or take a weekend and learn a lot about Windows to remove it. Someone in /r/techsupport can help, but that generally starts with going into Task Manager, and viewing your Startup items to find it.",
