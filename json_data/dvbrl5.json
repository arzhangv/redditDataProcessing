        "selftext": "Hi , ever since I downloaded a sketchy file and got my pc infected with malware I have been experiencing something strange. I did a virus scan with 360 ANTIvirus , but it did not remove / detect these exe's. The exe's keep popping up in task manager , one day there is about two or three of them , and the other day there is 50. They dont seem to use up much space , or bloat my computer , but I am still worried. When I open file location and delete one , it seems to make two(?) more of the same .exe's elsewhere. It also makes a weird invisible program open that keeps playing the windows 7 error sound every now and then (I have proof seeing as the program appears as \"sjakcvym\" in sound mixer\"   , other than that nothing happens. Should I be worried? What can I do to stop this? (The .exe's were named nuils.exe : notepad.exe : and now the last one that wont go away ; Slocombe.exe.",
