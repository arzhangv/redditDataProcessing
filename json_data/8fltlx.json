I figured it may have been from a clients PC so i  downloaded it from the link below and as soon as it finished downloading, windows defender and Malwarebytes went nuts and quarantined it immediately. \n\nWondering if any of yall have seen or heard about this. We checked all our toolkits and every one of them that had KVRT had  Trojan:Win32/CoinMiner.QM!bit\n\n[I downloaded it from KAS directly from this link,](https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/kvrt2015) and chrome and defender flag it immediately. Wondering if its the same for you, and if Kaspersky knows about this. ",
