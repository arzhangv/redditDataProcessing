        "selftext": "So I noticed a program called lockapp.exe running in task manager and I know it should be a legitimate windows program, it said it was suspended so I ended the task and then turned off my pc. When I turned it on again though, it would just constantly load my pc user and not take me to Desktop, so I booted it in safe mode (which had no problems signing in) and looked up the app in my system. It appears that lockapp.exe is a legitimate file so I tried to reset my computer and log in normally. This time it took quite a while and when it did my computer was acting slow. I know it wasn\u2019t frozen since caps lock still worked but I shut it down again. Before any of this, I haven\u2019t noticed any problems with my computer and it ran fast as ever. I also haven\u2019t noticed any suspicious files or processes. Mind you I\u2019m a little tech savvy since I use my computer to play games on it all the time. I was just able to get to desktop, but when I entered my task manager the cpu went from 77% usage down to about 5% or so instantly. That might be from just opening TM and the whole thing going nuts for a sec but I dunno. Any suggestions?",
