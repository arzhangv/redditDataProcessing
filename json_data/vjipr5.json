The veracrypt thing is meaningless because whether you execute something from a veracrypt mount or right off your C:\\ directory, it\u2019s literally the same. And (not trying to be a dick) but the fact that you don\u2019t understand disk decryption from runtime decryption is a huge tell that this is out of your league. The people writing crypters are in the business of tricking full-time, salaried professionals. \n\nIn order to do your research safely, you literally need another (cheap is ok) system with its own NIC. And also properly segregate this sys from the rest of your network.\n\nVMware, virtualbox, and online analyzers are all well known by encryption software. I.e an encrypted malware starts, checks for a registry key, or something else that is the same among all VirtualBox systems. Maybe it\u2019s a USB driver version or god-knows-what. This is called sandbox detection. \n\nIt won\u2019t even run the payload if it detects it\u2019s in a sandbox. However, there\u2019s a next level, where well engineered payloads are even nastier. They will bypass your sandbox and **execute within your host system\u2019s memory.**\n\nIf you know all of this then I\u2019m a pedantic ass\n:-)",
