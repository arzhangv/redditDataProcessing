If you need to RE malware you go with virtual machines and snapshots and you won't have any problem with anti-vm cause you'll find the workarounds as you go.\n\n If you just want to run malware for forensic artifact extraction and do not have a proper hardened sandbox I guess having a physical machine with snapshotting software installed is a good way to get some juice as not much malware detects that kind of software. Pretty useless though if you fill the machine with tons of widely known monitoring tools like Wireshark, install its network capturing driver and you'll be RIP. ALSO make sure you understand how the tool you are using works and backup your system before running any malware, there are some samples that will wipe any system restoration points or even set the infected state of the machine as the last restoration point.",
