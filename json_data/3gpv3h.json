        "selftext": "I need help understanding exactly what a malware loader is (e.g: Smoke, pony, elite). At first i thought loaders were light-weight modular pieces of code that would load the actual 'malware' into the target system via a method more subtle than conventional installation. However looking around online im finding actual screenshots of UI's for these loaders, which now has me thinking that a loader is either a platform for bundling/packing malware and various elements of a software based attack, or a sort of CnC.\n\nCan someone shed some light please? thanks",
