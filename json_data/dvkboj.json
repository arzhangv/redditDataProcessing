        "selftext": "I've disassembled a 64-bit Linux ELF malware that I know executes fine on my Linux VM. Because it executes fine on the VM, I know it's functional and would like to \"step through\" it in a debugger by setting appropriate breakpoints. I usually do this in x64dbg in Windows. But I'm having issues finding a good substitute for x64dbg in Linux.\n\nI can't use IDAPro because I don't have a license for it and IDAFree can't debug a 64-bit ELF. So that's out of the question. Ghidra can't debug it either.\n\nI know there's gdb but its CLI interface is too primitive for me to analyze a complicated malware. I looked into using edb and it crashed as soon as I loaded the malware in it. I looked into gdbgui (a gui for gdb) but there's no good documentation on it and I can't get it to even load the binary properly.\n\nJust wanted to share this experience with the community. Feel free to fill in anything I might be missing.",

Cutter maintainer here.\n\nJust for your information, and in order to avoid confusion - as for the time of this reply, Cutter does not have a debugger on its Release version nor Master branch. Support for a Debugger in Cutter is in an advanced development process and we hope to release it very soon. Meantime, I suggest checking the [Debug branch](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter/tree/debug) which is usable and contains the current work.\n\nAs for the recommended way to use Cutter - We suggest you to download the release version. For Linux machines, it is a simple AppImage executable. Get it on [https://cutter.re](https://cutter.re)\n\nPlease stay tuned for updates :)\n\nYou can join our Telegram group @  [http://t.me/r2cutter](http://t.me/r2cutter)  and follow the Twitter account for more announcements [https://twitter.com/r2gui](https://twitter.com/r2gui)",
