I checked them with Virustotal but Virustotal dont detect anything. When i delete them they are after a restart still there. Also in my autostart it created 2 paths:\n\"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\Start.vbs\"                                                                                         \n\"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\update_.exe\"                                                                                           \nIf i deactivate them after a restart they are reactivated.\nI try to search it on google but it seems like this virus is not common or popular.                            \n[Picture of Files](http://i.imgur.com/botMLUT.png)     \nI used  TDSSKiller-&gt;RogueKiller-&gt;Malwarebytes Antimalwarebytes-&gt;AdwCleaner-&gt;KasperskyCleanup2015\nand its still recreating files and autorun                                                                          \nI hope for some help :)\n",
