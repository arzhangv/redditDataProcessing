I'm searching for a \"bunch\", group of ransomwares, and, due to me not having a VirusTotal \\\\ Hybrid Analysis \\\\ Malwr account, i cannot get them (where i could, VirusShare, these are absent). I would want to analyze them, and see how they work.\n\nIf someone prefers e-mail to send the samples, i can give [\"SingeEsteViata@protonmail.com](mailto:\"SingeEsteViata@protonmail.com)\" as address. Otherwise, use a service that i can use / submit the samples to a malware pool i can access.\n\nSamples are:\n\nVigra ransomware (Viata variant): \"013ad8450b3f682b52901a204dabb4844ceb178367c2c4c38451cca72d66c21d\"; Android TV ransomware: \"2faaf3186853ab0b6432971bd4a739c772ceace80ea3404f313b305ac393f396\"; (referenced at [https://blog.newskysecurity.com/how-android-ransomware-bricked-my-tv-eff485c665ed](https://blog.newskysecurity.com/how-android-ransomware-bricked-my-tv-eff485c665ed))\n\n Linux KillDisk wiper: \"8a04f8481f1ef57f66b974802919e936c59a32d1cd9ef83186e6911b9ae773b0\"; \n\nOrdinypt Windows ransomware: \"085256b114079911b64f5826165f85a28a2a4ddc2ce0d935fa8545651ce5ab09\"; \n\nClop ransomware: \"d0cde86d47219e9c56b717f55dcdb01b0566344c13aa671613598cab427345b9\";\n\nThanks in advance to everyone.",
