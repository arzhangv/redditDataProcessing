It was infected with malware that installed a service called \"Network Remote Awareness\".   Siggen5 possibly?  It disabled Eset. The thing is if you google it, there are only **3-4 web results**.  Did I win the malware lottery with such a nitch infection?  \n\nI was able to gain control of the server and get Eset File Security running again.  Every malware scan I have run now is clean.   The server is going to be retired but is a business critical function currently.",
