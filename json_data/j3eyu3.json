For Virtualbox, set every Network Adapter to not connected. \n\nAfter that on your host, disable off WiFi and all network adapters linked to your VM and the ones connected to your host. \n\nAfter that enable Flightmode on your host. This is to minimize any damage to your other devices even if the virus were to break out of the VM. \n\nAnd dont run any malware in malware in KVM, run it within Virtualbox or VMWare. I prefer Virtualbox when running malware",
