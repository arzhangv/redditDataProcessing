It's pretty common for people to collate this stuff and share to the community.\nI am not suggesting for a second to blindly trust the stuff but more appreciate the context in how this stuff is usually shared, and more broadly make the point you're never going to get that level of assurance unless you manually reconcile it, by which point you might as well have just manually collate it yourself. If you're looking at making large scale changes of any kind I'd presume you'd not be blindly trusting stuff :)",

They have a twitter account set to private, they're in some kind of tech role at Oracle and I can't really find much else. \n\nWhy should we take some internet rando's IP block list at their word? Who are they, what are their creds, how did they establish the IP list? I'm not about to convince our CAB that some 800+ random IPs including Microsoft-owned ones should be blocked off the word of some anonymous github repo some other anonymous rando pointed me to.",
