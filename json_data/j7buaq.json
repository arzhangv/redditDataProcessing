I ran the apk and obb files through virus total and came out with 1 suspicion report but otherwise it was clean. I did a test installation and it ran fine, but it was ported by a Russian source who I am not sure if I should trust. It's from oceanofapk but I don't know how reliable they are. Please see the image below for the virus report. Thing is, that game has always been free so (not sure if ) I am breaking some DMCA law. It's just a port for a game that is no longer available but can be played offline. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oahap4ov2vr51.png?width=3358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9024d2687b013770b84b0b50abb995822e0314f4",
