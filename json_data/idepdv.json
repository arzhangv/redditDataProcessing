A bit like yara and Detect It Easy.\n\nFor unpacking either you do it manually with a debugger and dumping tools or you use specialised tools but PEID is none of them.",

If you're just at it to find out the obfuscator, I'd use [ExeInfoPE](https://exeinfo-pe.en.uptodown.com/windows#:~:text=Exeinfo%20PE%20is%20a%20program,exe%2C%20or%20simply%20delete%20it.&amp;text=In%20short%2C%20you%20can%20access,edit%20any%20Windows%20executable%20file.). It's got a signature database of about 4.5k at only the cost of a decent user interface (versus about 600 for PEiD)",
