Polymorphic malware has been a thing for years, but expect to see more malware that performs on the fly \"mutation\" to evade classifiers in the future. Think AI purpose built to evade other AI classifiers.\n\nA lot of companies are working on a lot of interesting stuff in this area, but as you can imagine much of it is secret. Start sniffing around though and I'm sure you'll learn more. \n",
