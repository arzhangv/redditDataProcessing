It would be interesting to develop comparison profiles and benchmarks for assessing outcomes form AI-based and conventional malware analysis protocols.  ",

For example in this analysis you can actually see \\`wmic.exe\\` executing a WMI query, passes it forward to the WMI services and the service creating the processes requested by the WMI query. \n\nThis is actually something no other platform is offering and quite amazing by itself. So in terms of visibility and understanding the behavior or abnormalities, SNDBOX wins for me in competition with the alternatives. \n\nFinally, seems like SNDBOX has a beta searchengine so you could literally find any malware behavior you like and study it your self later.",

Neither AV engines nor sandboxing succeeded in detecting it.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that they 'simply do not exist'  -- this would be the equivalent of saying that Higgs boson is an imaginary entity (without coming up with a way to test the hypothesis).  Furthermore, the point is not to belabor what we are pursuing at the moment, but to predict what we should be prepare against.  It is just a matter of time before AI-powered attacks come into play.  This is not a doomsday scenario, but being aware that 'unknown unknowns' do exist!

What bothers me is when people seem to go around touting AI drive/powered/embedded attacks which *simply do not exist* and even if they did, would be completely transparent to the victim as they would only see the result of the ML algorithm, not the underlying functionality.",
