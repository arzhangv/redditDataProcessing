I tried to download the release binaries and while they do execute, they don't actually produce any logs.\n\nI'm looking for a tool to trace all api calls made by malware on a windows host. I'm leaning towards using cuckoo sandbox but are there any other tools out there that would let me see all api calls?\n\nI have found a few tools out there but they are not working as advertised and I wanted to know if there's a good trusted tool for this purpose.\n\nI run flarevm, REMNUX, and kali for malware analysis.",
