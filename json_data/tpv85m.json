No idea who their corporate customers are anymore.\n\nIts less about a political decision and more of logical. It would be trivial to weaponize it in conjuction with malware. Theyd already know the signature, as they are known to have ties to Russian agency's. Its logical to protect the supply chain and citizens.\n\nDont pretend when push comes to shove, theyd [Kaspersky] have a choice in the matter.\n\nI know you're German, i checked your profile because i wondered if you were a Russian bot lol. Its a threat because of the privileges and its being handled.",

If you want only US Software on your phone and PC then good luck findling replacements for 99% of your Apps. I'm not from the US or Russia but as a German I feel like I woud still rather trust a Russian/Chinese Anti-Virus company then an US/German one, the US is well known to spy on everyone already and to force companys to do that too. If I woud life in Russia on the other hand I woud definitiv use an US Anti Virus Software \ud83d\ude09",

KSN does this so technically your sending content to the company that could be private.  This works if you trust the company, the reason I think the government has blacklisted them is because they have proven untrustworthy.  Was it the company or or was it unscrupulous workers that caused this lack of trust, hard to say.  I have always suspected the Shadow brokers collected files from a automatic file collection system.   It\u2019s speculation but the timeline works, the charges also line up with the blacklisting and other interesting things the government did not say.",
