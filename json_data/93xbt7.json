I love to download APK files and I mean I love to. Of course I was taught the ABC of downloading shit but even that couldn't stop my idiocy. \n\nAnyways, I was trying to torrent a free mod of the Google play library.(mistake#1, it's impossible) I like any good idiot clicked on the first link cuz why not\ud83e\udd37(mistake#2). Then once on the site, I saw a big green button with FREE DOWNLOAD written on it. So what do I do? I fucking clicked it(mistake#3). It then redirected me to an ad page with the usual are you sure you want to download message from Google at the bottom. Of course I didn't see the huge Red flags so I motherfucking clicked yes. It took 15 seconds to download and as soon as it did, I opened the download manager to install it. It finished installing and guess what Happened when I went to check if it worked. Yup you guessed it right. fucking nothing, nada. Ok this is where any sound individual would uninstall the program and just find a new one. Well I'm not a sound individual. I had already fucked up but what ensued next is next level retardness. Lik",
