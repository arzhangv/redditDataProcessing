I see it in dissasembler but the images of the articles are in pseudo code.\nIs there any function to do that or did they a fully reverse of the function and then code it?\n\nCan you give me some tips about how do you usually start an analysis with IDA?\n\nExample: the first image of https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2017/05/the-worm-that-spreads-wanacrypt0r/ with the domain in a comment.\n\nThank you for your time.",
