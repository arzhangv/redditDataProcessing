Being the dunce that I am, I used what I thought was a trusted website as opposed to the Developer's website. it finishes the download, and I tab out of the window. a few moments later, I notice the download window is still open and it's downloading Linkey (a known spyware masquerading as a \"convenient extension\") and god knows what else. I quickly close the window and run a MalwareBytes scan. It finds a few things, and I delete them, along with the \"extension\" and the program, from my control center. The moral of the story, kids? DON'T USE SOFTONIC.\n\nAlso, [This](https://www.google.com/search?q=softonic+virus&amp;rlz=1C1CHMO_enUS547US547&amp;oq=softonic+&amp;aqs=chrome.4.69i57j69i59j69i60j0l3.8282j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8) ",
