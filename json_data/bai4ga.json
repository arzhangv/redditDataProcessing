If you go to the filter icon (to the right of \"Type hash to search\") and if you go to the verdict section there is a hashtag # bar. In there you can type \"ransomware\" and it will look for all the submissions where the verdict was ransomware. Then you can pick and go through the submission and can download the samples. I am not responsible for anything you do with the ransomware though just so we are clear just for research purposes only.",
