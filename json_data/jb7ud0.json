What I never understand is, how do you actually load the sample on the VM? Do you use a shared folder before and then remove it? Do you download it directly in the VM and then reset it to local-only? What's the process exactly? Thanks!",

Downloading directly to the VM is also an option, but for some use-cases it's better to keep a copy.\n\nIf you want to be *extra* safe, you abstract this back onto linux, i.e. Linux hypervisor -&gt; Windows 10 Pro VM -&gt; Windows Sandbox.",
