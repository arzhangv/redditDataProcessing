Someone from the ClamAV team said they would check it out, but figured it may be of interest here. I'm hosting it on my personal site for now if anyone wants to check it out.\n\n[FTDIUNIN.exe download](https://letsprint3d.net/FTDIUNIN.exe)",

It alerted because it used a very niche Chinese programming language as the installer. That same language was used years ago in a fairly wide malware campaign, so AV engines decided that everything using that language was bad.",
