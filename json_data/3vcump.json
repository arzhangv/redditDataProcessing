I'm fairly sure my machine is compromised but I'm not sure if this is a new malware or not.\n\nAnd I got this file through subscribing to a torrent RSS for South Park - magnet link included\n\nThe entire payload is ~40 megabytes and the rest of the torrent file is zeroed out padding.\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:onltqjq3rhz2qmqeu3fkzy27go7hbys5&amp;dn=South.Park.S19E09.720p.HDTV.x264-FLEET.mp4",
