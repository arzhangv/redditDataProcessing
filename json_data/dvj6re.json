I think it's a vulnerability in the netBIOS protocol(please see the pcap file in the link)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any feedback let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I don't think this is being spread via exploit. This appears to be distributed with a maldoc, which means likely malspam. Some community comments for that hash show it being labeled as a PS3 custom firmware. The infection vector in that case was a .scr file, which kicked off the miner and contacted a pool at mine[.]moneropool[.]com. One of the domains it tries to reach out to (jobtests[.]ru) is listed as possibly being related to a NeksMiner campaign a while ago, but that intel is sorta old. AlienVault is hit or miss with a lot of this stuff.\n\nMy guess? Generic miner. Came in through malspam with a link to the payload. It's a fairly common infection vector. Occam's razor states this is more likely than a NetBios exploit.",
