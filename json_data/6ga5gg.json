Some weeks ago, I posted a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/6cwht1/avatar_project_final_edition/) here about a book that I had made available for free for some period of time. If you've been to my website since then, you may have noticed that my book is [no longer there] (https://blindseeker.com/AVATAR). That's because I've finally gotten the damn thing officially published. Here is a [link] (https://blindseeker.com/blahg/?p=915) to a blog post I wrote up about my experiences writing this, some hints with regards to self-publishing if you were thinking about writing up a book of your own, and where you can find my book if you are interested in buying a physical hard copy.\n\n\n\nThank you for your support, and the positive feedback for the free edition of my book. And if you choose to buy the published release, thank you in advance for your patronage. ",
