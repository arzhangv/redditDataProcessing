This VM ran malware doesn't interact completely with the infected system like a traditional Rootkit/Bootkit would.\n\nThe implications of this method are obvious and has sparked my curiosity in the past couple days. I haven't found much information concerning the subject via normal forum scrapes. I was hoping someone reading this thread could point me in the direction concerning this malware \"stealthing\" technique.",
