I am currently comp-TIA network+, A+, and  security+ certified but I have no programming experience. I prefer teaching myself as my current living situation prevents a classroom environment. I was hoping the malware community could give me some advice on where to start in terms of what to learn first, good online teaching programs (free or subscription-based, if it's good I'm willing to pay), etc.. any information is greatly appreciated!!",
