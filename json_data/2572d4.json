Would be great if you could check it out and give feedback :) It's basically a monitoring centre for internet threats with maps, the ISC ThreatCon, McAfee malware DB etc.\r\rLink is http://malwarezero.org/malwarecentral (it requires registration which might not be working as we've had a problem with sending emails recently, if it doesn't work just PM me and I'll get you set up)\r\rCurtis\r\rEdit: Until email sending is reopened, accounts should automatically activate.\r\rEdit 2: There is an issue with our registration system which means you must reset your password before first login. Please do this in order to login.",
