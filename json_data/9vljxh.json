I caught 3 batches of similar malware, albeit older versions:\n\n* https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/cscript\n* https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/cscript/cscript2\n* https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/campaignE\n\nI caught them with a WordPress honey pot that has a  fake WSO web shell, which was used in the installs, so I have no examples of how it actually gets used, and I'd love to see that.\n\nI think this paste](https://pastebin.com/qUM2RubB) may be the same malware, but it has no context.\n\nI also think [this analysis](https://medium.com/@pmarrapese/analysis-of-a-php-backdoor-c9ee3e60e810) is of the same malware.",
