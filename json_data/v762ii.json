Specification is here.\nhttps://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/resources.html#taxii-21-specification\n\nhttps://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-server\n\nIt isn't typical for organizations to build TAXII servers, unless they are a security vendor, but they often connect to TAXII servers to download threat intelligence documented in the STIX taxonomy.
