Now my windows defender says that i have 120 status: active viruses. Dos viruses. Is it possible that dos viruses became active on windows 10 without executing them? Maybe that active status is something else. But im scared right now :D.  I just wanted to see how they work in dosbox. Why windows defender says active?\n\nscreenshot:   http://i.imgur.com/T9HpH4K.jpg?1\n\ndownloaded from http://vxheaven.org/vl.php?dir=Virus.DOS",
