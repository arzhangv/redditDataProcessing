It asks me for some personal data and 3$ for an order confirmation or some shit. Is it possible for me to check  if it installed a virus on my PC? This site has the classic \"connection is secure\" in the web bar but I'm still suspicious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS THE SITE IN QUESTION**\n\n[https://nipec.com.np/simpll/login/](https://nipec.com.np/simpll/login/)",
