But after then, I no longer continued with malware analysis.\n\nNow I would like to resume my journey in malware analysis with some real world malware (of course I will read again the book to refresh my memory).\n\nAny ideas on how can I continue from here as a hobbyst? (By hobbyst I mean, no internships or expensive courses, I just like RE and in a future maybe game hacking).",
