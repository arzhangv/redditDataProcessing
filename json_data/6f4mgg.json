I can't remove it through extensions and my antivirus (MalwareBytes) won't detect it.\n\nI've looked up solutions but they all require me to download a specific program to do so which seems a bit sketchy if you ask me.\n\nPlease let me know if anyone else is encountering this or knows how to remove it safely.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, it spams me and redirects my new tabs to ads or other pages claiming I have a virus. Seems to be trying to get me to download a virus or more malware.",
