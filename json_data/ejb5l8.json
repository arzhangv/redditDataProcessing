            "comment": "You need to have a good understanding of how the things you want to write malware for work. A good starting place that goes into a little bit of everything including malware and how ELF works is \"learning linux binary analysis\", you can find it on Amazon and other places. Thats a good start, I'de also recommend practical binary analysis bit not as good as other book. Make sure you are a strong C programmer and make sure you know how to spot vulnerabilities as well. Once you have strong fundamentals(from the books or from wherever), I like looking at conference talks, you can find them anywhere",

            "comment": "I don't really think C will help you in this situation. Mail related malware in the form that you want is rare these days. It is also highly dependent on your OS and what client you are using to read emails(like outlook vs browser). In general you would need to find an exploit in one of these programs that would enable you to do what you want. I don't know as much about PE or Mach-o, but I do know ELF so lets focus on linux. If I was you, I'de learn ELF so that you can understand how certain pieces of ELF viruses work. There are a lot of resources for those, you can google around for it. I am going to assume you are not into UEFI kits or anything that low level, but maybe you are interested in either low level malware like ELF viruses(which do usually involve C, but you can also use Python these days) or maybe you can look at browser malware/vulnerabilities.",
