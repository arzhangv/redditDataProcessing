            "comment": "If the malicious files keep coming back after being removed it is normally because there is something else on the machine that isn't being detected and is dropping the files. Or you have another infected machine on your network and it is dropping the files across the network. Sophos have a free tool (Source of Infection) that might help with this: www.sophos.com/kb/111505 \nbasically what you need to do is remove the malicious files, then run the tool with an admin command prompt and leave it running until the files come back. Once you spot them you can close the tool. Then go to your %temp% folder and you should find a csv file, it will list every file that has been created on the machine since you started running the tool. locate the malicious files and if it was a local process that created them it will give you the name of it, if it was a remote process it will give you the IP address of the machine that dropped them. Hope this helps.",
