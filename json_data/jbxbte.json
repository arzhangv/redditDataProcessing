They claim that they received a text message saying 'Hello Salut' and then once they replied, were getting notifications that information was being changed (as such would happen normally if it were you). Everything was stolen, bank info, Social Insurance (this is in Canada). Everything was stolen within 15 minutes.\n\nHow is this possible? This seems incredibly scary.",
