Today when I ran it twice, each time when it started up the  \"boot time scan\" was about 3 seconds and then a yellow triangle pop up  would appear saying \"AV boot time scan create file\" and you have to  click OK and then seemingly it starts up but does not appear to do any  scan at all.\n\nCan anybody help with what's going on? I update Avast daily in the settings, so it is current.",
