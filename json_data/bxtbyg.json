That is a very small cost of learning an incredibly valuable less about information security.\n\nAll of my private clients pay the ransom unless they have proper backups in place.  Of course, if they did have backups, they wouldn\u2019t need me to help them identify point of origin and post breach threat hunting.",

Sure paying the ransom fee would\u2019ve been cheaper but who knows if they would have actually kept up their end of the bargain.
