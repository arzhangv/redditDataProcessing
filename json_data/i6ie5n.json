I'm not sure how great of a resource this will be for learning about a random ghidra feature. Currently, I'm interested in knowing more about renaming and retyping variables in the decompiler window. I see, at least what I think to be, strange behavior. Upon committing changes, the decompiler creates more variables for the previous variables that I have renamed or retyped.\n\nPersonally I'm glad I bought it, but I'm not too focused on it till the epub version is released. I typically read this kind of material electronically and the current early access PDF is not very flexible in e-readers.",
