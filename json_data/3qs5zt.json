The app that was silently installed was DNS Unlocker. I thought it was wierd and went to remove Adblock after I uninstalled DNS Unlocker and Adblock extension removal redirected me to a page with malware. I thought it was possible the desktop was still infected but scans revealed nothing. \n\nSo fast forward to today. I'm on my laptop and the same issue happened, but this I am on Amazon, TP-Link and Google.com. Adblock was still installed and went to remove it with the same results of being redirected to malware hosted sites. \n\nThe only conclusion I can figure is Adblock is silently installing this rogue app DNS Unlocker.",
