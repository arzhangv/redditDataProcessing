If this has been executed I would try and run 1768 on it to see if you can get any other beacon information from it.  I will also link a few other things.  I'm just a blue teamer just trying to help.

            "comment": "Just to add to the other comment, what you thought was a hexdump ist the actual shellcode that is executed. The script does the following using native API calls: allocate read-write-execute memory (VirtualAllocEx), copy the shellcode to that memory location (RtlMoveMemory) and execute it by creating a new thread (CreateThread). To know what that actual payload is, you have to analyze the shellcode. Maybe I'll take a look at it later when I find the time.",

            "comment": "Looks like you found what you were looking for. As a future reference the second you see stuff about invoking system DLLs or assemblies (especially reference to kernel32) just know that it's calling the windows API directly so all those weird functions are api calls. And anytime you see reference to VirtualAlloc you're probably going to be dealing with it injecting shellcode into memory. So it's always a quick spot",
