        "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just released a new video in my Introduction to Memory Forensics series. \"Volatility Profiles and Windows 10\" explains how to analyze memory from newer builds of Windows 10 (Creators/Fall Creators Update). Spoiler alert: you'll need profiles for build 15063 or 16299. While you may have the newest version of Volatility installed (2.6), you may *not* have the newest profiles installed. Learn more here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us1gbPqtdtY\n\nPlenty of other digital forensics and incident response videos here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/13cubed",
