I was thinking more learning how to do it. When i search up things like how does metasploit escalate priveledges, i usaully get a page saying \"type getpriv to escalate\" or something like that.\n\nHow can i get the actual info like this([https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/04/02/what-happens-when-i-type-getsystem/](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2014/04/02/what-happens-when-i-type-getsystem/)) \n\nDo you have any sources of priv escalation, or a place to learn about this without finding misguided news articles, and useless script kiddy-ish sites. (I have been looking at the msdn documentation for things i know about, like pipe impersonation)",
