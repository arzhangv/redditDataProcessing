It covers several topics including creating a virtual network, configuring the machines, running INetSim and Burp, and analyzing TLS encrypted traffic. I also included an example use where we analyze the traffic generated by the TeslaCrypt ransomware.\n\n**https://blog.christophetd.fr/set-up-your-own-malware-analysis-lab-with-virtualbox-inetsim-and-burp/**\n\nHope it will be useful!
