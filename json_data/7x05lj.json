I have already grown found of Cuckoo Sandbox(https://cuckoosandbox.org/) and is probably the system my thesis is going to focus on.. However I am having a hard time finding real Cuckoo opensource/free competitors. So my question is, does anyone here know some 'good' competitors I can use for comparisons? Free web-based solutions like VirusTotal and so on is not what im after. Thanks in advance :)",
