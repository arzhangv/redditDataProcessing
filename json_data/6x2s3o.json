I didn't spend too much time looking at it or reading it. I was unable to close the window so I preformed a hard reboot. I eventually connected my internet connection to my phone where it will remain, since I'm actually moving out of my place on the 31st.\n\nAfter I checked my browser history, and it registered several dozen hits to the same website (same time stamp on all hits), which I'd rather not check to see if it was real or not since it had a really blunt name to it.\n\nChanged some passwords and such.\n\nConsidering it locked up my browser, was this a malicious pop up or a hack?",
