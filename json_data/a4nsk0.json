It's an HTML file which would redirect to a jar. Most browsers will at that point complain that this is dangerous, but even if it didn't it would only download it, not execute it.\n\nI won't argue that this is still not the best behavior, but I'm not sure I would consider this a \"0 detections, for shame\" style moment. This is an HTML file which doesn't do anything and the link is dead. Context is important.... Then again maybe that's just me.",
