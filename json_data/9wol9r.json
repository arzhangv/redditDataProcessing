We\u2019ll first run the tool against evil.pdf from the last episode in this series, and we\u2019ll find that it can easily extract the embedded Word document that we were able to manually extract using pdf-parser. Then, we\u2019ll run the tool against another sample PDF that contains embedded images.\n\nEpisode:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr6gQXErdc0\n\nChannel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/13cubed\n\nPatreon (Help support 13Cubed):\nhttps://www.patreon.com/13cubed",
