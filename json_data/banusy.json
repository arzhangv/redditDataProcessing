Has anyone seen this ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe client saw all the files renamed to \\*.jumper. They took a photo with their phone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen the ransom came up. They freaked out and powered down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been to site to take a look however, server now does not boot due to corrupted RAID.\n\nthe machines are on the way back to the office now but I wanted to jump in and ask if anyone has seen this before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nID Ransomware called it \"Jamper\" which I assume is a spelling error\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/identify.php?case=ae2ad39165dbba8ffb71446db6ff3620d1386b07](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/identify.php?case=ae2ad39165dbba8ffb71446db6ff3620d1386b07)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have resurrected the server (when they downed it, it killed the RAID).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have worked out that the process began at 5 am Monday morning before staff arrived at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know who is the owner of the file.\n\nWe are now trying to get his PC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooks like another RDP attack as this client runs their own IT and will not listen about passwords and RDP access. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt that time of the morning, Likely came in via RDP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---README---.TXT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour personal id 159A31C3C3\n\nAll your important files are encrypted! \n\nThere is only one way to get your files back: \n\n1.
