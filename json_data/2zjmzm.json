A drop down menu froze on my desktop and my windows fire wall went down and wasn't able to be turned back on. My mcafee stopped scanning and a command prompt box came up looking like it was planning on deleting system 32. I restored my PC to a week ago and now am running malware bytes and mcafee. All was fine until mcafee quit scanning at 98% and is not making progress and malwarebytes has slowed down considerably. PLEASE HELP. Sorry for any typos but I can't fuck this up. I didn't think the could happen to me.",
