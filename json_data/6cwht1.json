I'm also known as da_667, and 'that guy what shitposts a lot'.\n\n\n\nSome months ago, I submitted a post to this subreddit and several others with regards to the AVATAR project.\n\n\n\nLong story short, it is an extremely detailed guide I wrote dedicated to IT and Security professionals to help them build a secure, self-contained virtual lab environment on any one of five commonly utilized hypervisors.\n\n\n\nI'm posting this to inform readers of this (and several other) subreddit(s) that I have made considerable progress since I was here last. In fact, I just published the last copy of the book I am making available for free before I take it down, pretty it up a bit, and submit it somewhere for self-publishing.\n\n\n\nVisit https://blindseeker.com/AVATAR to get a free copy before I take it down later. Yes, the book is 14MB in size. Yes its a pdf. No, it doesn't contain malware. No I won't be releasing it in other formats (as of right now).\n\n\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed the book and want to throw money at me, My patreon is over at https://www.patreon.com/da_667\n\n\n\nI hope that this doesn't constitute as spam, and if it does, my apologies in advance. Have a nice day!",
