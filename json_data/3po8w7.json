But then some random guy at school gave me a Windows 8 USB stick. It worked. The problem is, I don't really trust that guy. So here's my question, can a rootkit/bootkit be installed with Windows during installation? What if the Windows 8 USB stick already had malware on it, would an anti-virus solve the problem?",
