I never had any PC (only some laptops) and this thing was everything to me. \nI always work for something if i want it, and this year i had all straight A's, and was hard working, so my dad decided to buy it for me! Sadly, today i turned it on and started up a game i really liked, and the PC acted weird. It would often do the blue rotating thing next to my mouse arrow but i was in full screen and could not see what is going on. When i left the game there was shit ton of hentai tabs open, some invisible setups, updates, and all my files became NPPP. There was a message in my files saying that i can have them all back for like +$900 and bunch of random Chineese text. I managed to get rid of the virus but all that i had downloaded on it is gone. Thankfully i have a backup of my photos at least... sorry if this disturbs you or does not belong here, i just feel so bad about it. I will reinstall the system and i hope this never happens again. \n\nPlease take care of what you are doing online and do not pirate stuff \ud83d\ude4f stay safe out there guys.",
