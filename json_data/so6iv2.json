            "comment": "Windows defender will proactively scan your computer every so often as a preventative measure. Not all malware is actively running when it's found. Without knowing exactly what signature and file it took action against, I can only speculate. However given recent experience, I've noticed that defender has been alerting on   files that are not malicious themselves, but are vulnerable to some big name CVEs like Log4Shell and a python library thing I forget the name of. Both were resident on most of my machines because I use programs that need the files in question, but not frequently, and certainly not at 3am when the scan and alert happened on my systems.\n\nBig takeaway here though should be that malware has evolved to the point where it's tricky enough to usually execute and do it's nastiness without a user knowing. Stealth capabilities used to be the exclusive domain of big bad nation-state APTs. Nowadays, everyone has that baked into their executables.",
