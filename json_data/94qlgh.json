I run anti-virus and anti-malware scans frequently too.\n\nI just ran Malware Bytes and found this file: CLV SP3.4.5.GIF\n\nThis is the 3rd time in the last 3 weeks I have ran Malware Bytes and each time it finds this file. I quarantined it the first two times but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. Malware Bytes classifies this file as malware.\n\nWhat should I do about it?",
