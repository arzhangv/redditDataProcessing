Is there a good free online course I can take, a book I can read that would give me some incite on where to go next?\n\nI have no idea where to begin on processing this kill chain.",

It's one of the fastest ways of finding poorly written malware's persistence mechanism.  \nIf it is a decent rootkit, then like above, volatility will be one of you best choices.\nCommon Persistence Mechanism Areas:\nTask scheduler\nRegistry - the run and run once keys.  Don't forget to check the Wow64 registry key too!
