Inside I found two links for doc and pdf version to the manual. I didn't download anything from said links but I dug deeper and send it through virus total, only one engine classified it as  Solarmarker. From what I understand to get properly infected I would have to download and run any of the additional files form the link but I would feel better if somebody would confirm me this.\n\nlink to additional analysis:\n\n[https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/35b04591f1a9e1686b21eccc18b1e1da2b0e12a4c307ac1249aa3e7705e16329/621bfff0c5a9a5228a417ac2#mitre-matrix-modal](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/35b04591f1a9e1686b21eccc18b1e1da2b0e12a4c307ac1249aa3e7705e16329/621bfff0c5a9a5228a417ac2#mitre-matrix-modal)",
