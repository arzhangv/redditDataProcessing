Are there any tools that use this form of detection?\n\nI know that VICE uses integrity checking to find rootkits, but as far as I'm aware it only checks the integrity of specific kernel tables (SSDT, IAT, etc) and not the entire kernel image.  Is there anything preventing rootkit scanners from employing this method, if they don't already?",
