I realized that my mouse was drifting when i press CTRL SHIFT S to open up snip. and when i went to \"Type here to search\" my keyboard was acting like the tab key was stuck. Is this some sort of virus?A restart and windows update fixed it . I had a problem before a few times a week where my KB would be stuck on some key, like W closed a window instead of typing W.\n\nAlso a full malware scan with Win defender detected nothing and SFC scannow detected nothing\n\nImgur link to what im talking about: (yes ik this is from my tiktok page dont judge) [https://imgur.com/a/XFvxIyY](https://imgur.com/a/XFvxIyY)\n\nTLDR, \"keyboard and mouse went crazy and did random stuff, no viruses detected, reboot fixed it. Virus, Y/N?\"",

Once you install it, Go to Settings --&gt; Security --&gt; Enable all the Scan Options.\n\nThen run a full scan. \n\nYou could also run a test by using a different mouse and see if the same behavior occurs. If it doesn't then look at updating any drivers related to the keyboard and mouse.\n\nI reckon it is more driver/application related than it being a form of Malware.",
