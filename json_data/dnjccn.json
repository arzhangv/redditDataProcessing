        "selftext": "So I have what appears to be a malware program that keeps launching itself on my MacBook. The icon is a little green circle with a magnifying glass in it and the software keeps appearing under different names, the most recent one being \"IdeaShared.\" I believe I accidentally downloaded it with some screenplays I found on r/Screenwriting. I keep moving the software to the trash via the Finder, but it keeps re-appearing and launching itself while I'm in the midst of doing other things. This is the first time I've dealt with something like this since moving to Apple products and I have no idea the first place to start! A brief Google search didn't yield me much help at all. I could use some help finding, identifying and ridding myself of this malware; if this isn't the appropriate community to post in, I could use a redirect.",
