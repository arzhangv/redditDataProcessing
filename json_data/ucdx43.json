If you have a pihole or something, this should do the trick. (I use it on mine). Obviously this isn't the ultimate list or anything.\n\nNote - DGA's are not covered here as they are non deterministic usually, so... you know... you cant generate their urls.\n\n[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xenios91/AlienVaultURLS/main/alien\\_vault\\_urls.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xenios91/AlienVaultURLS/main/alien_vault_urls.txt)",
