If you encrypt your Win10 hd with bitlocker and then make a second partition for your Ubuntu machine, I guess it wont be able to decrypt the content because it is missing the bitlocker-key right?\n\nSo if I were to execute a ransomware malware it wouldn't effect the encrypted partition or am I wrong?\n",
