        "selftext": "Hello, I recently had a gmail account hijacked, I use the account purely for job websites - Monster etc. because they send so much spam.\n\nThe password is easy and it is the same one I use for all job websites, there is nothing really worth accessing on the email account other than my name and address etc. but it probably wouldn't be the hardest thing to find anyway with twitter, facebook etc.\n\nThere is nothing else connected to the account like amazon etc.\n\nI have multiple other emails that use complex long passwords that do have sensitive information that would possibly be of value but I haven't had any issues with them or any other banking or online shopping accounts. So should I be worried about this email getting hijacked or could it just be a case of a weak password and a possible security lapse at some of the job websites I've visited?\n\nI use MSE, Malwarebytes, SuperAntiSpyware, Spywareblaster and Noscript to protect my computer, scan frequently, careful about what websites I visit etc. and everything comes back clean on all my scans.\n\nThank you.",
