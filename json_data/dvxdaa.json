I take this beyond the surface level and try to find ways to make the code itself look legitimate or to find a way to write it so that when it does something underhanded, it appears justified. \n\nThinking of polymorphic encoding, I did write such an algorithm a while back to be used for byte encoding. Pretty robust, but can have a fair bit of overhead. I can send you a link to the project if you're interested",

I'm familiar with NASM, as well as how shellcode works, but the few tutorials I've found and followed didn't work for me. Might you know of any good tutorials or resources that go into depth about how to write Windows assembly for shellcode?",
