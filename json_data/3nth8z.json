Is it possible?\n\nI am thinking of implementing a chrome extension to provide additional security layer. So I would like to know whether the trojan can modify the behaviour of my \"security extension\" that easily. I can understand that the trojan might be able to easily uninstall the chrome extension without user knowing it (uninstalling is not a problem, but hijacking/modifying is).\n\nAlso, are there any special security mechanism to prevent the tampering of a chrome extension?",
