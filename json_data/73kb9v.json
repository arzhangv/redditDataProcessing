Tons of people use this bot to make public games to help others level(Diablo 2 is very old and community getting smaller, these bots help people find games to level)\n\nHere's the link for the github page wiki where the download it.\n\nhttps://github.com/DetectiveSquirrel/Version-Hack-Guide-1.14d/blob/master/README.md\n\nhere is the actual download on the site.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/szost/8c27dcd72e.rar\n\nOn virustotal is shows up as malware on  2 parts, the rest comes up as safe.\n\nI'm wondering if this is a false positive and make sure this is safe to use, I know people can go in and change files at any moment.\n\nLots of people run these bots, so it's not a unique type bot that's unknown.\n\nI would like to try and get this bot up and running soon, so finding out of this is safe or not will decide if I can go to the next step! Please!\n\nAny help will be appreciated, thanks!",
