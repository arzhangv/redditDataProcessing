I couldn't get into my account info, but I was given a surprise of being offered a chance at a new iPad or gift card.   Now I get two or three tabs of adware in my Chrome browser when using it.  Also, Amazon doesn't show https:// (DigiCert Security Padlock) when visiting the site.  \n\nThis is the first time I've ever gotten malware on a Linux-based computer.   Using Ubuntu MATE 15 Wily Werewolf, right now.  I guess I'll have to reinstall everything  after a wipe.  This is the same exact reason why I left Windows OS a few years ago.  I guess Linux is no longer safe and easy.  \n\n\nI'm not an expert, so I'm just making an assumption that some type of script has been put onto that website I mentioned.  I figured, I was safe from that attack while using Ubuntu.  The only other thing I can think of causing all of this is program I installed via the terminal called I-Nex last night.  However, that's just out-there paranoia from me.   I have no clue what caused this exactly.  ",
