In class one day, I was given software from a shady source and was told that it had malware in it, get rid of it and successfully run the program.  I believe I have done so by running superantispyware and windows defender then manually deleting it.  Yes, I am a dumbass for not putting it in the VM but the current question is should I at this point feel at ease enough to run the program?",
