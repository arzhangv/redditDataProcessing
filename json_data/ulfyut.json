I for the longest time was trying to get a hit on any of them until this past week, i did. \n\nI only had time to upload about 1/3 of what i had and when i first dropped them they came up clean. Looking 30 mins later from my phone, about 75% of them hit. They were:\n\nTrojan.Win32\n Trojan.Win32 Jobutyve\nTrojan.Win32.Aie\nTrojan.Win32 ibyj\nTrojan.Win32 Fsysna.ibrm\nTrojan.Win32 Icuc\nTrojan.Win32 Cobalt\nTrojan.Win32 hzr\n\nTrojan.

Others just recorded a month ago. And again, about 25% still did not hit. My question is how do i and who do i give these to for research??",

So it\u2019s not as easy as \u201cupload it here\u201d. That being said, many of these systems are integrated one way or another such that if you upload it to a popular spot it will show up on multiple places.\n\nLet me recommend the following:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com\nhttps://www.hybrid-analysis.com\nhttps://any.run\n\nCheers :)",
