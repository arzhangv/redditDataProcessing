Plain and simple.\n\nI got a new laptop, do some online shopping and a lot of cloud storage/work as I am a teacher and we are in the new world of post-covid hybrid of online studying while in class. (My students all got free iPads and I use a Acer Aspire 5 Laptop, worksheets, PowerPoint slides, videos etc get shared online through Google Drive rather than the old fashioned paper format.\n\nBut the details aren't important, I use the cloud often, I do some online shopping, I stream sport on those free sites (looking into getting a proper service where I can watch football and Rugby here in Asia as it's not on tv so I stream them)\n\nIf you don't have experience, any other advice would be appreciated, thanks.",
