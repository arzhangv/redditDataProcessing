        "selftext": " Hello malware analysis hivemind! \n\nAs part of an ongoing research I have a few dozen thousands of infected machine IDs generated by a few different trojans, all of them assumed to be commodity malware.\n\nSo far I've been able to cluster them into 4 distinct groups based on syntactic properties - length of strings, delimiters used, tokenization etc.; I'm now interested in trying to attribute each group to a specific trojan. I do not have access to any samples or an actual infected machine, only the GUIDs.\n\nFor example, assume you've encountered this GUID in an investigation - \"613K3K84-S5578977-110O57F-4E7Y8Y0A-092PQ720\"; since it has very distinct syntactic properties, one could easily gather that this is an AZORult infection (based on the ID mentioned [here](https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/threat-spotlight-analyzing-azorult-infostealer-malware.html)).\n\nWhat I'm essentially looking for is a way to identify other, more obscure ID structures. Any resource that contains this sort of information would be welcome, or I'd be glad to share some examples for GUIDs in a PM.\n\nThanks!",
