As far as I'm concerned, it should be no security issue. I've googled various things regarding this and could not really find any useful information. The application does nothing else suspicious so with this being the only thing that got my attention, what do you guys think? I somehow suspect it's something that VMP does. Confirmed malware samples which I analyzed before always had some more suspicious actions.",

No outgoing network connections, no system files which are being manipulated, no registry entries being manipulated, no additional processes being created etc..\n\nAlso, the application itself seems to work fine. I'm not going to go into much detail as I've received the file from a friend of mine who wanted me to check it out but so far it seems to be perfectly fine.",
