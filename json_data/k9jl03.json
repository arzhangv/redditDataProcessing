Most AVs also do some other fancy stuff but that's the basic idea.\n\ni coded a port scanner in python with a Gui and i made it a exe with pyinstaller and and windows defender immediately flagged it as a virus and removed the exe? then the hashes wouldnt be known right? because i just coded it? so why does it get removed?",
