Also overall i havent found any useful tips on how to get rid of this trojan without installing some new software that might just make matters worse.\n\nSo if somebody could please help me get rid of this i would be really greatful, like i said ive read that this is a pretty malicious trojan and ive had no luck removing with spybot which is the only thing detecting it.\n\nPlease help.",
