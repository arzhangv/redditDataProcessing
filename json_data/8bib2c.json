Being paid would be nice, but really I just want to be able to bounce my results off people (the only analyst I know is my cousin and I must drive him nuts).",

You'll also have other things like sqli, webshells, struts, lfi/rfi, other rce and dos stuff as well though, which is an added bonus for more exposure to malicious activity just without the PE formatting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Response will allow you to identify and clean up the malware from hosts. Use the indicators you find to hunt through the infrastructure to see how far it's spread. Mainly use dynamic analysis and sandboxes to help you get IOC's fast so you can secure/clean the environment quickly. Most incident response jobs do this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reverse engineering will allow you to understand the malware from more of a code perspective and identify the functionality. This is pretty useful for intelligence and attribution mainly. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's not. Useful for Yara and network signatures. Sometimes the curiosity outweighs the pain of asm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Threat Intelligence, mainly used for research into threat actors, tracking their infrastructure, that kinda stuff. Hard work but good fun when there's good tracking of a threat actor. Sometimes the feels outweighs the difficulty.\n\nThere's been a lot of research from looking at Malware/Exploits from a theoretical perspective this area is called Program Analysis/Formal Methods. Also aren't there analysts who approach the analysis of malware from multiple perspectives ? Some RE guys go from binary to threat intel in their reports.",

If you have trouble getting a copy of the analyzed samples on your own, contact the author. Good companies will usually not shy away from sharing samples to people who ask for it properly (ie not anonymously). Try to find new things that were not mentioned in the report and let the original author know. This will get your name out there.",

Would you like to work for a corporate entity trying to defend their networks?  What about in the public sector - critical national infrastructure as an example?   Decide WHO you want to work for and reach out to them - show them what you can do and ask them what they think.  This shows not only are you capable of doing the job but you have *initiative* which is a seriously important soft skill and will impress.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Depends ... \n\nThere's multiple domains within malware analysis. \n\nUsual way in is either through a SOC or CERT.\n\nIntrusion detection will allow you to understand malware solely from a traffic view, maybe you'll get logs on top of this to confirm but it's mainly 'heres a pcap of some weird traffic, figure out what it is using osint'. You'll also have other things like sqli, webshells, struts, lfi/rfi, other rce and dos stuff as well though, which is an added bonus for more exposure to malicious activity just without the PE formatting. \n\nResponse will allow you to identify and clean up the malware from hosts. Use the indicators you find to hunt through the infrastructure to see how far it's spread. \nMainly use dynamic analysis and sandboxes to help you get IOC's fast so you can secure/clean the environment quickly. Most incident response jobs do this. \n\nReverse engineering will allow you to understand the malware from more of a code perspective and identify the functionality. This is pretty useful for intelligence and attribution mainly. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's not. Useful for Yara and network signatures. Sometimes the curiosity outweighs the pain of asm. \n\nThreat Intelligence, mainly used for research into threat actors, tracking their infrastructure, that kinda stuff. Hard work but good fun when there's good tracking of a threat actor. Sometimes the feels outweighs the difficulty. \n\n\nIf you're still in school, think about applying to a SOC or a CERT as a junior. Otherwise reverse stuff, throw it on twitter and tag a few people in, have fun helping the community ... \n\nOh and conferences, sometimes you meet the online people irl, opens a network of opportunities,  it's weird but yeah ... \n\n",
