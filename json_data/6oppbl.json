It depends on the scope of the attacker and what physical setup your mobo is running.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, once your BIOS is infected you're fucked and will need to buy a new mobo (because fixing it at a workshop will be more expensive).  \nIn a best case scenario, you fix it yourself with the press of a button.  \n\nSo basically, YMMV. BIOS resetting isn't always an option due to shitty mobos, and even if it is, a sufficiently sophisticated rootkit could be hiding in other places as well, just waiting to re-infect the BIOS.",
