This is going to be a bit longer.\n\nIf the situation is a dire as OP says, technical interventions only go so far and a lot of the internet actively encourages users to work around or turn off those interventions, and some legitimately. It creates a bigger support headache in the long run with the user: constantly complaining that things don't work right or working out how to get around it.\n\nNo matter how old you are, you do learn from mistakes and disasters, I didn't really go into my original post about how to protect private information in the face of impending disaster, and that is a tricky one to solve, but many security suites do a lot of work actively detecting exfiltration or important personal details.\n\nI've seen it time a time again, before I was a teacher I did in home tech support for a large number of people who had already done dumb things, they were all very humble and actively learning how to use the internet properly while I was there, with many happy to pay me an extra hour or two to teach them how to do things properly.\n\nExcept one woman, extremely technically incapable, except when it came to disabling whatever technical interventions were placed in her way, and had no comprehension that the \"anti-virus\" she bought, twice, was actually a rip off and putting more viruses on her computer.\n\nAnd that's where I come to my second paragraph, get a tablet. This has been very effective for many people I have recommended it to. My aunty has an Android tablet and I have my email as a backup account, and about once every two months I get an email from Google about how a website or app was blocked from her Google account. I also haven't heard from her for years with technical support enquiries. She still has a Lenovo laptop gathering dust, but doesn't use it anymore.",
