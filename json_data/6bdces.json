I've followed the official documentation but when I get to ['Running YARA for the first time'](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#running-yara-for-the-first-time) the command *yara my_first_rule my_first_rule* fails with the following error: \n\n    my_first_rule(1): error: syntax error, unexpected _TEXT_STRING_\n\nI can't find any documentation or help on this error and it's happening across multiple machines.  Tried the 32 and 64 bit versions on Windows for 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.   Feel like a super noob and that I'm missing something completely obvious.  Anyone know?\n\n",
