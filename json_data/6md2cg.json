I'm wondering if anyone else has actually done this successfully because info online about WinDbg with Virtualbox is very very slim. I don't personally know anyone with this experience and even people on the Microsoft boards haven't known the answer. I've done the BCEdit baudrate, debug on, serial port 1 thing, got a GUID and rebooted into kernel debug mode but still can't get a connection.\n\nIs there another way to do this without the COM pipe entirely? I've heard of USB as well but not sure how that would work with a VM. The whole thing just seems kinda ancient.",

If you're on Linux host, you can't install two VMs:\n\n- Windows Host VM: The only which will run the WinDbg and debug the guest VM. This is also where the VirtualKD would be installed if it was possible.\n- Windows Guest VM: The debuggee.\n\nTherefore, this is possible only if host system is Windows, but doesn't work if host system is Linux with 2 VMs.",
