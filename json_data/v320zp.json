            "comment": "SIFT is supposed to save you the time of installing and configuring every tool/package, and lets you try all kinds of DFIR software.  Everything just works out of the box.  If there's only a few programs you want to install then you might be right, you don't need SIFT.\n\nBTW apparently there's a few programs that come with SIFT that aren't free to use in a business environment.  So that might be a problem depending on your situation.",
