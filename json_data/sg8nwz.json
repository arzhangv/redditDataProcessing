Pec been running smooth for months i didn't go to shady sites didnt download anything shady exepct yesterday my inner child couldnt resist the nostalgia of playing pokemon again so I downloaded pokemon acreus from a shady site i rebooted the pc since then quite sometimes but in the morning after i booted it up i got a secure boot failure could it be that the game contained a malware that affected my firmware ? Is it safe to continue to windows and should i rest my pc if it could be dangerous?",
