        "selftext": "I was finally able to get some really stubborn root kit file after having it first infect my computer on the first of November. I used all of the top malware, altivirus, and rootkit programs and, believe it or not, it couldn't find it. Finally I ran Bitdefender in the rescue environment before it came across [Rtkhdasetting.zip](https://Rtkhdasetting.zip) in the System32 folder, which was password protected so as to not get scanned and discovered, and a few scattered bits of infected Realtek audio drivers, which I reinstalled. The only lingering effects are my trackpad still goes off and on from time to time so I think the driver itself may still have problems. I just found the files and had Bitdefender shred them or just dragged them to the trash can and deleted them. So far Windows 10 is able to operate fine, I think, without too much getting messed-up.\n\nBack in November I did do a fresh reinstall, yes from a USB drive, and this still stayed in the system folder, inexplicably. It was so frustrating because I thought I had it then 2 weeks later I would be using a banking app on the computer and my mouse would go crazy trying to click around the site after high-jacking my mouse. \n\nTook all of the .zip files out from the system folder and anything password protected from the Rescue Environment so I think I'm okay, for now. Is there any way to know for sure that it's gone. I spent a few hours going line by line through the Task Manager for active and background processes and it all looked okay, but I was fooled by thinking that, as rootkits do, what I was seeing was a normal corrupted Windows process.",
