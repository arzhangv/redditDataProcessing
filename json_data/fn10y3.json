I was curious enough to click on it which redirected me to [google.com](https://google.com).\n\nThe URL is :  [http://q6idnawboy7g.com/](http://q6idnawboy7g.com/) \n\nIm not urging you to open it. Although it redirects to google it might be an IP logger in which case you should open it through a VPN. Try using  [https://hide.me/en/proxy](https://hide.me/en/proxy) \n\ncarrying out a whois lookup it seems it is from cyprus although i cant seem to get more info. Can anyone help me track this down and unveil its true purpose?",
