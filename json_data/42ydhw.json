Afterwards I restarted my computer and scanned my computer with malwarebytes, it found the same so I cleaned again and restarted my computer, now after I have run malwarebytes which didn't find anything and currently scanning with windows defender, which hasen't found anything so far. \n\nAny tips how to make sure all of it is gone? I'm very paranoid when this kind of stuff happens. ",
