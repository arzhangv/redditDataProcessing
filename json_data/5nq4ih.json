It appears that it uses a zero day in windows explorer to autorun the files installing two drivers. \n\nIf anyone knows the autorun commands that Stuxnet uses that would be great! Thanks! \n\nEDIT 2: After more investigation 'shell execute' or 'open' within autorun are used by Stuxnet these call the 'shellExecuteEx' or 'createProcess' functions.",
