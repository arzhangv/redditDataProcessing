I have very little knowledge of antimalware/antivirus/antihacking technologies. Is this the best combo or should I go with a different freeware, or buy a specific firms product? When I research it they all seem the same to me. I also use Tinywall as my firewall. Is this pretty good, or should I use/buy something else? (either physical firewall or virtual). I just use my computer for normal residential stuff and working from home.",

            "comment": "Kaspersky or Bitdefender are ranked really high consistently. Funnily.enough I was doing some research her is a Youtube channel PC Security Channel who is focused on testing out AVs. He seems to have been doing it a while and seems to report the same Kaspersky and Bitdefender. To me Bitdefender is new so I just went with paying for Kaspersky. I know historically in the past it was the best and to see it 15ish years later still high rated gives me confidence in the ability to do it's job. However I dont think they have a free version...and I know Bitdefender does from that YT channel. So if your sticking to free. Maybe Bitdefender. I haven't used MalwareBytes AV ever or their Supplement scanner (if they still have that) so no comment. As far as Avast, I work as red teamed and sometimes have to mimic exploits or bad stuff and on my past VM I grabbed it and used to download all sorts of stuff and write my own and I can't say I was too impressed with it. It was just decent in my experience",

            "comment": "There are several organizations that test AV programs. The one I prefer is AV Comparatives (https://www.av-comparatives.org/). They have a number of different tests but here's a link to their latest \"Real World\" test (you can use the dropdown to chose other tests): https://www.av-comparatives.org/comparison/\n\nWhile the \"Best\" changes with each test Bitdefender and Kaspersky are always at the top. I use the paid version of Bitdefender. The free version uses the same AV engine, it just lacks all the extras.\n\nIn this particular test Avast did fine, Malwarebytes not so fine. It had a lower detection rate and several false positives.\n\nMalwarebytes is usually used as a \"second opinion\", just run on demand. It is good at finding things that are already in the system, not as good keeping things out in the first place.\n\nAs someone else already mentioned Windows Defender is fine for most people. It wasn't always that way but Microsoft has improved it quite a lot over the years, as you can see in this test.",
