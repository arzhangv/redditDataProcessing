Powershell opens up right after I delete it and then it closes after a few seconds and I see the system64.exe file just reappear. I know its a virus because I did a MalwareBytes scan and it said it was a virus, plus its disguising itself and VLC Media player inside of task manager when I don't even have that installed. I'm pretty sure its a bitcoin miner. How do I uninstall it? Also sorry if this is the wrong place to be posting.",
