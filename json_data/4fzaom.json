Running the macros on my sandbox machine and looking through the kill chain produced by our threat analysis system doesn't show any network connections, child process launches, or any out-of-the-ordinary file writes/modifications from Word. I'm at a loss for what this thing does, exactly.\n\nHere's the original doc along with the extracted macros:\nhttp://www.megafileupload.com/6zev/word_macro.zip\n\nAnyone have a clue how to go about deciphering this programmatically?",
