I searched in several free malware repositories but i didn't find them.\nTheir SHA256 hashs are:\n\n\n07812a4f0bfa313e86ee95d61a32fbbe01905113768ebaef12cf2d4d67592a92\n\nb0d7afb1c51d21ccf7c85caae049f05f616d80bb6cfd6aa816eeb13b2c5874e5\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Outside of your firewall you\u2019ll see LOTS of crap hitting you all day. Check the logs and see if it makes it through. Most firewalls have a feed from the vendor that auto blocks known crap and bots. I\u2019d suggest watching allowed traffic first. Then look at volumes of external traffic (allowed or blocked) to mKe sure you don\u2019t get DDoS\u2019ed. Some vendors fail open when they can\u2019t deal with the volume...and won\u2019t log it sometimes. Also if you don\u2019t use a cloud WAF/DDoS service, such as CloudFlare, talk to your ISP about blocking options including ports.",
