Is there anyway to know what it did so i know if im in trouble? i just changed password for that specific account. This person had similar problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/UzRIQuQqfjE where they gained access to his email which is odd since they dont ask for log in information. So how could it happen?\n\n\nedit: it wasnt mere spam, WhatsApp email was sent by using a friend's address. Thats why i didnt think twice, thought it was really WhatsApp.\n\nedit: The fake BBC article is discussed in length by security experts here: http://www.threattracksecurity.com/it-blog/garcinia-cambogia-spam-a-timeline-and-new-outbreaks/\n",
