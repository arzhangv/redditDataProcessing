            "comment": "I imagine you'll be focusing on PE file format mostly, so you'll need a VM with Windows on it. You can checkout ready VM images from the offical Microsoft page \\[[https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)\\]. Most malware are x86 bit files so in most cases you'll be fine with an x86 machine. Of course you can downlaod the x64 bit version if needed.\n\nThe basic idea is to have the analysis machine off network and with network discovery turned off. When mounting shared folders make one of them read-only and a separate folder with read-write permission. In the read-only folder you can keep analysis tools installers and various other files which you don't want to possibly get infected by the malware. For example, there are ransomwares which will also see your shared folders and encrypt them as well, or malware that injects payloads into other executable files. That way you avoid malware spreading onto your host / losing data on the shared drive. If you have the need to pull out files from the VM (e.g. unpacked samples) use the read-write permission folder. Put \"not so important\" data on that one and **never run anything** from that folder from your host.\n\nFor dynamic analysis you can set up a 2nd VM that will sniff the entire traffic from the victim machine (with Wireshark and inetsim). That way you can catch any relevant network communication (C2's, 2nd stage malware links, etc.). Put both VM's in the same network so that they can see each other. Some other tools that can be useful for dynamic analysis is the [Sysinternals Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite) from Microsoft. That way you can track spawned processes and registry changes. [RegShot](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/files/) is also another handy tool for viewing changes done to registry entries.\n\nFor static analysis all you really need is a debugger. You can use [OllyDbg](http://www.ollydbg.de/) or [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/#start) (I personally prefer the latter). I also like to run [IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml) on my host machine to label functions and keep track of everything. [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) (hex editor) can also be useful so you can quickly copy shellcodes or patch the samples.\n\nThat's all I can think of from the top of my head... Happy hacking!",
