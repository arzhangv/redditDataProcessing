        "selftext": "I have had two things happen in the last couple of days. One: some weird notification popped up within Windows. It was like the standard notification in the bottom right corner, that has an arrow you click to close it. But the contents of it looked like spam. Then I did a search on Bing and clicked one of the results and it redirected me to this page: [http://prize9546.dreamteam10.life/8076410511/?u=gmqk605&amp;o=55hppzy&amp;t=main7&amp;f=1](http://prize9546.dreamteam10.life/8076410511/?u=gmqk605&amp;o=55hppzy&amp;t=main7&amp;f=1)\n\nI went back to Bing and did the same search again and clicked the same link again and this time it went to the website instead of redirecting me. I have run Malwarebytes and it didn't find anything.\n\nI never go to shady websites, and don't install that many programs. The last program I installed was Audacity, that I downloaded from [https://www.audacityteam.org/download/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/). I don't know if that came with some sort of spyware or what, because I cannot understand what else could be causing this. Any ideas?",
