Specifically, you might have to downgrade the openssl libraries in order to get ssh-in-the-browser to work. \n\nI use that with labs I made for a class I teach, see https://security-assignments.com/about.html There, I sell access to a pre-built kali pentest lab image that university students use. You're welcome to build it from scratch though.\n\nYou could alternatively just much more easily add nested virtualization to a regular, non-kali, GCP-supported debian instance: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-virtualization/enabling",

Emphasis there on *other* instances -- you can attack your own.\n\nFor pentest stuff, including malware analysis, I've set up kali on gcp with nested virtualization enabled (libvirt). Then I connect to kali via Chrome remote desktop. I have a windows nested guest vm on there, too. It's kind of laggy, but good for my purposes. If that's the kind of thing you're looking for, lmk and I'll share some more stuff.",
