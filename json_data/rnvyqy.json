        "selftext": "Earlier today my Windows Defender as well as Malwarebytes identified 18 threats as BitCoin Miner Trojan. Then I ran a full scan with Hitman Pro and Zemana and now I have no threats. After that I observed that a Brave extension is missing.  \n\n\nThese files were created a week ago, but I didn't experience any difference in my laptop's speed, or overheating etc. I use a Firewall and I can identify every single application that is allowed to have network access. I also use anti-tracking extension on Brave and a password manager. So, I was wondering if my data and/or passwords can be exposed by this kind of Trojan. Are there any further steps I am required to take?  \nThank you!",

            "comment": "So.... i would look via VirusTotal with the hashes of what was flagged to see specifically what you are working with.\n\nThat should tell whether these Trojan's you have can exfil personal data, keystrokes etc. \n\nAlso I would via thru your web history on the date it was created to see of any websites youve gone to. \n\nWhat could've happened is you went to a phishing page on accident which downloaded the BTC miner to your PC.\n\nAlso judging PC speed isn't the best option as many Trojan's are running \"quietly\" with lower processing powers to keep you from noticing.\n\nHope this helps. DM me if you have further questions! Good luck!",
