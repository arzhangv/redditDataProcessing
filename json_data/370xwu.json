Is there a irc channel for the community :)?\n\nSome of my questions are:\nI'm looking at a win32 binary that loads a resource via LoadResource and returns a pointer to the loaded resources. How can I save or disassemble the loaded resource ?\nAnother question is regarding DLL injection related to service DLLs.\n\nThanks,",
