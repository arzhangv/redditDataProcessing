Same Macbook model, ROM, EFI version, ROM Bios files names and warnings.\n\n\nCan someone explain to me what do these findings even mean?  I'm also really worried about the identical file a few days ago, aren't firmware dumps unique for each system? Or same model machines have same firmware dumps i.e. all MB Pros Mid-2012 will have the same dump?\n\n\nThanks!",
