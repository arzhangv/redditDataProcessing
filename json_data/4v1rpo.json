I work at a computer repair shop and recently had a customer come in with a seemingly new version of the cryptolocker virus, I found that the virus came from an email on her outlook in a zip file, I took it off and put it in a dummy computer to see it in action. However It appears that you must be connected to the internet for it to run, either that or it has a delay when it starts encypting files. I copied the program to a text file and included it here. If anyone is able to read the code and tell me what exactly it does please let me know what you find!\nhttp://textuploader.com/5ezqc",
