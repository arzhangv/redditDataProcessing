They exist to translate programming languages into lower level languages.\n\nIn your situation, I would choose one popular programming language (out of convenience, so you don't have to rewrite code so much). This language should be supported by several different compilers. Then I would compile the code with each compiler and check the differences. \n\nE.g. Python has a multitude of different implementations. The most popular implementation is CPython (it is compiled to .pyc, and interpreted afterwards).  Then there is Jython, which will run on the JVM. IronPython is a .NET implementation. Finally: Nuitka compiles Python to a C level program. So there you have already four very different results for one language.",

Usually, if you switch the programming language, you will also use another compiler, thus create a different binary than before.\n\nWhat will be affected by this:\n\n* blacklisting --&gt; the binary is different, blacklisting based on hashes is circumvented until the binary is blacklisted again (so it only works for a certain time frame) \n* pattern based detection (no matter if static or dynamic) --&gt; pattern signatures are created on known malware files, so like blacklisting you will circumvent this for a certain time frame until patterns for your new binary are created; it might be hampered for a long time if the technology is not supporting the new execution environment. E.g., if a static scanner is not able to extract the actual code from an AutoIt binary, there is no way to create a pattern signature for it.\n* behaviour blocker --&gt; there can be a change if your execution environment changes due to switching the language. Some behaviour blocker rules might be depended on that execution environment, e.g. it might treat a powershell.exe process differently than a Java application. In most cases it shouldn't be affected, though.\n* emulation --&gt; this is affected if the execution environment changes, the new environment might not be supported.\n\nIn conclusion I would say, that the question should be a different one. You can switch languages and use the same compiler, this would have almost no effect on the antivirus being able to detect this file. Switch the compiler to something very different, e.g., switch from native to bytecode, use environments that are less common and less likely supported by parsers of antivirus scanners, and it may have a huge effect on the ability to detect those files.",

If a signature is matched like a hash, malware can be detected before it executes, but if it's in a new/unknown language, antivirus have to wait for it to execute and than detect if anything suspicious is seen. This lateral analysis gives virus a chance to not only be executed, but also to evade detection.\n Note that many antivirus will flag any program in a new language (even a simple  print hello world!) as suspicious, just because of these reasons. \n\n\nWindows defender supposedly can run these programs in a virtual container, safeguarding other system files and data.",

            "comment": "Depends entirely on if that AV is using static or dynamic analysis for its engine. Most these days use a combination of the two working on concert with each other. So in the case of static the engine is usually hashing all the files in a filesystem and comparing those against a list of known code; if it finds something it recognizes it quarantines it. The problem with this method is that its no good at finding new samples of bad code. It would already have to have a definition of what is and what is not malware. By contrast dynamic code analysis is usually looking and the system calls that programs are making to the kernel and other parts of the OS during normal execution. If a certain program makes too many calls that pass a certain threshold then it will flag the program as a virus. The drawback with this method however is that the malware has to run on a target machine in order to get flagged if at all.  \n\n\nYou should looking into [msfvenom](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/) and [esoteric programming languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page) try compiling some simple reverse tcp shells against an esoteric language and then running that by [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/upload) you may get some interesting results.",
