We believe that, while it may have reduced our daily subscriber count, those who do subscribe and read this subreddit are redditors who are truly interested in what you have to say. It's our hope that, while you may only receive a handful of questions, the questions that do get asked will relate to something you are passionate about.\n\n**After the AMA is concluded, we will sticky a post with anything you'd like to share** \\-- whether that be a website, book, github account, twitter profile, or upcoming conference talk -- anything you'd like to pitch or get the word out about.\n\nr/Malware mods have begun working on a shared document where we have begun to compile a list of candidates for AMA invitations. **If this sounds like something you'd like to do, please** [message the moderator team](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMalware) **and let us know to add you to our list.**",
