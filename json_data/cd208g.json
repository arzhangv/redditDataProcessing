I figured that if the attacker was daft enough to be parsing or running config files blindly then you could kind of get a reverse shell to other systems (Your own code rather than random data). But then there are lots of ethical and moral questions there as you would be compromising systems that have already been compromised.",

Ie. known vulnerable or configuration pages for common CMSs. \n\nHave you noticed that bots actually do stop making requests or spend time parsing them when using this versus not?",
