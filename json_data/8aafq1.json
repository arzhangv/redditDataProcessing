I think the best feature of this malware was the fact it would eval() the return of a GET request. That's the big part I wanted to share. Nothing new, we have seen cryptolockers and many more types of malware do this before. However, it's so stupidly easy with PHP we really should start incorporating this into detection engines somehow. None-the-less thanks for your feedback.",
