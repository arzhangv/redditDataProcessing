He had backups but they were network-attached (already told him how that is not useful).\n\nSo at this point, with no public decryption tools available, I am investigating other options. I have heard of services that offer to be mediators in ransomware payments where you only pay if the decryption is successful.\n\nHas anyone had experience with any of these companies?\n\nI have also read that with sodinokibi, the outcome for decryption is nearly 100% successful because the decryption website is automated. Is this true? Any first hand experience?\n\nThank you!",

Neither offer great protection Imo in 2019..\n\nSide note, I am logging the Sophos web console for managing multiple companies. The Kaspersky one has to be installed at every site and never really worked properly. Leaving some machines un-updated..",

I think this was our only saving grace.. \nI was able to set the server up in a new VM and remediate all the infections on the PCs. \nKaspersky endpoint security11.2  did not  stop or even impede the virus.. we moved onto Sophos AV, which immediately found all the nasty bits so we could clean or format the machines.\n\n1 side note,  I actually had to recover the server twice.. the first restored version which I thought was clean, ended up having sodinokibi hidden and protected in VSS recycle bin... major piss off. All good 2 weeks in now.\n\nGl man. This one kinda sucks.",

Generally the fees come in as well under the difference there and they're very up front on the pricing.\n\nPayment is made up front and is still made at your own risk.",
