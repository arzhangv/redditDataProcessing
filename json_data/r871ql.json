I am still not sure this is the right place but I wanted to put it somewhere as I did not find much info online.\n\nTwo days my phone crashed while browsing and restarted.  \nYesterday NetGuard reported that Samsung Pay Framework tried to connect to [188.40.142.18](https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/ip/188.40.142.18) on port 123. I can't think of a good explanation for it.\n\nIf anyone is interested and wants to find more or get file samples before I wipe the phone I should be able to get select data via adb. If I don't hear back I will wipe the phone in a few days.\n\nThe apps we reasonably up-to-date (update about once a day when the device charges) but the phone itself is old, S8+ on the latest Android 9 OS available, from spring 2021. I was using either Firefox or DuckDuckGo Browser and I am not sure of the site I was browsing either. I had developer mode on before the crash, probably one more vulnerability that was exploited.",

Recent port probes by shodan.io shows the NTP port reporting like an NTP server should.  Modern security (especially certificates) is often time based to avoid replay attacks, so I could see the program reaching out to an NTP pool to get the current time for authentication purposes.\n\nI'm not saying that it's not malware, but there seems to be good reason to believe that this might be legit.",
