Emotet initially appeared in 2014 as banking trojan, has evolved now into more modularized version to carry out other malicious actions. Trickbot is banking trojan that once steals banking related information from the computer. Trickbot is also a modular malware, the threat actors use it to deploy their malicious codes.\n\nI have come upon a sample that belongs to the Emotet strain. Trickbot is embedded with the Emotet strain. Once Trickbot starts infection, it connects to a malicious domain to probably download other threats.\n\n [http://vsintelli.com/portal/blog/67-analysing-emotet-and-trickbot](http://vsintelli.com/portal/blog/67-analysing-emotet-and-trickbot)",
