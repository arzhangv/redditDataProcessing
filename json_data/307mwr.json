I have a very expensive appliance that does analysis, but the reporting lacks in a lot of ways and I'm looking for more of a good storage system.  \n\nSo I'm looking for a system that maybe does barebones static analysis of executables (hashes, strings, imports, etc). I'm looking for something with a web interface to upload files and a decent search function. Like show me all samples with \"something\" in strings, show me all files with user32.dll as an import, show me all files compiled before X time that are larger than X, files with \"something else\" in the notes, etc. Something like mastiff looks good for data gathering but there's no search interface as far as I can tell from reading up on it. I've just been storing samples in a folder but I need something better.\n\nSo what do you guys use? Or do you have any suggestions?",
