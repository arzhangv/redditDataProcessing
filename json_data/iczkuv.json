There's a lot of great resources here and interesting discussions that I think are valuable, and a lot of times hard to find elsewhere. \n\nBUT, over the past few weeks the amount of \"how do i hack a pdf\" or \"hOW cAn i iNstaLl kEyLogGer\" posts have just gotten too damn high.\n\nMaybe we could add more content to the wiki, and direct basic posts asking for help to there? I'm here to seriously research and discuss new malware emerging in the world, not participate in random hacking discussions. If someone wants to ask a specific question about the making of some piece of malware, sure, that's awesome, but this is not r/HowToHack.\n\nJust my .02",
