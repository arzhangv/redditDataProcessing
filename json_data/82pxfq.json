It popped up for like 5 seconds then disappeared. As I was watching, when I saw it I was thinking to myself, \"that's weird...\" A few seconds after the QR code disappeared, command prompt came up on my computer.. (I had nothing else running on my laptop at the time, only google chrome in incognito mode.)\n\nThe command prompt showed some lines of text and it was super quick I couldn't read what it said. After the CMD prompt disappeared, i quickly reset my computer and ran to Reddit to share what just happened.\n\nAdvice???",
