Fun fact, DLLs (and all DOS executables, to include the .com files) also have the same magic number of MZ, so you can't rely on just that to determine if the file is actually an exe or dll, you have to look at the COFF header after the PE signature.",

It's a good starting point to understand the underlyings of the Windows operating system and how you can extract information from a file and determine if it is malware or not (for example, storing another .exe in it's body, and during runtime it opens a file, writes the executable code in it, and then executes it).\n\nHope it helps you if you want to pursue a career in malware analysis :)",
