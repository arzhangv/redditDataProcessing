It comes down to experience, maybe. You need completely different tools (ILspy/DNspy), which has its own debugger. Beyond those issues, it's very simple. If it's packed, de4dot can detect and automatically decrypt most types. You can set Watch values for just about everything during debugging. You can even change the instructional language _during_ debugging to make it dance for you. e.g. the malware crashes if you're not on the Internet. So just change the line of literal .NET code to something different, where as standard C/C++ malware would require you to change an asm instruction or change the Z flag.",
