I am thinking of planting multiple malwares into the system. The question is where can I find malware files for testing, I saw EICAR testing files but are there any more alternatives or extra sources that I can use.",

How about you compare file copy, windows boot time, read write performance (using different program load times) and software installation times before and after installing the anti-virus since all AVs using DLL hooking methods to check malware activity. These time should be lower aka system performance should be higher without any AV on the OS. \n\nOther than that you could always use malware to test out how the performance takes a hit. So the experiment would be:\n\n- System performance without any AV\n- System performance with AVG\n- System performance with AVAST",
