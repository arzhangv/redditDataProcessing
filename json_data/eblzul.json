The page is themed like a Microsoft page and tells her to simply run the file to be virus free. It even has a big arrow on the page pointing to exactly _where_ she should click to run it.\n\nHappens all the time. The people most likely to accept the notifications are those most likely to get infected. Using google images is pretty good because you get a good stream of clicks from all types of people, and it\u2019s apparently easier to get higher rankings than classic search.",
