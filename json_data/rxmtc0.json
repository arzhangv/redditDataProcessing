There was a guy who was reverse engineering malware for years in his spare time. For him this course was too easy. I wouldn't take 710 unless you have looked at a few dozen malware samples and reverse malware for windows, Linux, powershell, macros, etc.\n\nI did enjoy it but you could probably learn this stuff if you take a couple of weeks of your own time. For me, a month of my time costs more than the course, so...\n\nWork study is \"only 2300\" and used to be 1300 so it really makes sense for those prices. Considering wages in the USA for security people I think 8k training makes sense from an employer perspective.",
