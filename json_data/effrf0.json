It asked me to disable my adblocker which I did otherwise I thought I could not view the content. Which in fact I could not watch at all and my pc opened like 5 shitty camsites at once. Looking through my browse history I saw a suspicious site multiple times with adress oyi9f1kbaj. Looking this up on google it states that it is in fact a malicious site. \n\nMy F-Secure did not throw any notification whatsoever. What would you guys recommend me to do in order to keep my machine safe? I ran a virusscan and malicious software detection tool and both came out with no virus.\n\nThanks",
