Basics are the same : find OEP, dump, fix dump, restore imports.\n\nNow if you want to dump process hollowed stuff, its often as easy as put a breakpoint on WriteProcessMemory (or the Zw/Nt equivalent), check if the buffer looks like an exe / dll and dump the relevant memory page.\n\nOfc you may want to do that on a VM.",
