Through the magic of sysmon I tracked down a process id, which is linked to Chrome. By exploring that id it seemed to relate to the crashpad service inside chrome.\n\nI am still doing more probing but I do wonder, is it a thing for some kind of malware to change the crashpad upload url's maliciously? And if so, where might I find a setting like that stored?\n\nThanks all.",
