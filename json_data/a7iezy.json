These are potential use cases for people who want to disable the sharing of samples.\n\nI'd say that it is offered for privacy reasons in case a sample that is submitted isn't meant for the AV. Think of a false positive which is submitted automatically. Otherwise I cant think of much. The above mentioned two things are directly against the purpose of the AV, so I doubt that the AVs keep this in mind. It isn't likely either that a lot of machines have AVs installed on which an APT is developed.",
