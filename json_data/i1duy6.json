Sometimes it won't run unless a specific version of Office is installed (like one we saw this week). Or needs to connect to a certain web site. And, even if it connected, that same malware may have a list of other backup servers to connect to. Without RE, those backup servers wouldn't be found because automation only found the first.\n\nFrom there we can build upon static analysis with YARA rules and the like to try and identify what family of malware it belongs to, then use that group it into larger trends. e.g. is it yet another Emotet, or is it Emotet with major evolutions. Or did a new actor fork a known ransomware for themselves. All of those require dedicated RE.",

            "comment": "So, I\u2019m going to take this in a bit different direction here, but I think there are a couple of things that have been left unsaid so far in the answers that could be useful to you:\n\nFirst, you say you are interested in reverse engineering - that\u2019s awesome! But are you only interested in RE as a method of malware analysis?\n\nIf so, keep in mind that RE is just one of several techniques used for malware analysis - As others have mentioned, sandboxes (automated or interactive) are another, as is static and dynamic analysis. \n\nIf you are interested in malware analysis, you can think of these methods as different tiers in a malware analysis skill set pyramid: At the bottom (least experience/effort needed), completely automated sandboxes. Then static analysis using tools (need more knowledge of what to look for, but don\u2019t need RE experience to use these tools). Then dynamic analysis (requires a bit more knowledge of debugging and patching programs, but even then there are tools that can help). \n\nThen, at the very top, you have RE - it takes the most time and requires particular knowledge, but it can be learned even without a dev background, and produces the most valuable outputs from malware analysis. \n\nIf you want to do just RE, you\u2019ll also want to learn the other tiers of this \u201cpyramid\u201d so that instead, you can market yourself as a malware analyst with RE experience. Certs are great, but expensive, so you could instead start a blog or GitHub repo with your RE/malware analysis work and really demonstrate your value in extracting information that can be used to learn about and defend against malware. \n\nNow, on the other hand, one thing I haven\u2019t seen touched on here are the other applications of RE: RE is a very desirable skill set in the gaming and, more generally, software industry for anti-cheat development and secure code analysis. By code analysis, I mean RE is also desirable for someone who is working to find bugs/vulnerabilities in software. \n\nThese are some alternative career paths outside of malware that you could consider. But regardless of which area you find most interesting, be prepared to expand your skill set to include other complementary skills (like the other tiers of malware analysis or software development principles, etc.)\n\nI hope that helps and feel free to DM me if you have questions about these different career paths; I work primarily in malware but have some peers who do RE for secure coding and anti-cheat. \n\nBest of luck and share your work sometime!",

I haven\u2019t been in this field for a long time so I could be completely wrong. Like 5 years ago you could check the OS name, Hardware ID, GEO-location, or even had a time-lock algorithm that delayed payload execution until the typical timeout for sandboxes(1m 30s). Now I\u2019m sure it is rather hard to fool a modern sandbox like cuckoo or run.any. Though I MAY be completely wrong.",
