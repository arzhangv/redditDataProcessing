The best rule is, if you have Windows, Windows Defender is the way to go for anti-virus. Windows default Firewall is also strong and does the job well. As for anti-malware, you will probably want to go for Malwarebytes, ADWCleaner or Hitman Pro or anything else from trusted providers really. But for a more in-depth answer, refer to the Reddit above!",
