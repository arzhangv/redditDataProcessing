            "comment": "Unfortunately with online ID ransomware your only options would be\n\n1. Wait until the key for this becomes known in the future by someone who coincidentally got compromised with the same encryption key\n\n2. Cut your losses and wipe the files.\n\n\nUnless you've got some really important irreplaceable files in there (e.g. Family photos or Work documents)\n\nDo NOT pay the ransomware for recovery, as payment encourages these criminals to make more ransomware and strike again.\n\n\nAlso in the future, please tell your friend to place their files within the documents folder and turn on Windows Defender Ransomware protection, as it will stop literally any program from accessing those files unless given explicit permission in the warning notification.\n\nThat or if this occurred on a device where Windows Defender was your main AV, might be time to try the market for some free Antivirus plans.\n\nBitdefender is currently the most popular and proven to be the strongest free plan in the market (Minus Kaspersky amid fears of Russian government ties cause...yeah...)",
