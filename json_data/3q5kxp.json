I was going to press the life counter icon in the app, when all of a sudden - Opera launched with the following:\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4130839/Screenshot_2015-10-24-18-49-57.png\n\nNotice \"geogle\" in the URL. Google turns up nothing (search using quotation marks.) I know ovsev298.com is the domain.\n\nClicking \"OK\" Then loads the Google Play Store, and display an antivirus app named 360 something.\n\nThe full URL is:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4130839/Screenshot_2015-10-24-21-50-48.png\n\nAnyone else had this happen? I scanned my device with every conceivable antivirus and antimalware app I could find, but nothing malicious was found.\n\nAny ideas?",
