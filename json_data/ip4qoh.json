The group would then revive these old conversations, add malicious files as attachments, and target new users with a legitimate-looking conversation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Users part of the conversations, or those added on, would often open the malicious files attachments added to the email thread out of curiosity and get infected.\n\nSame old song and dance. Malicious attachments (.doc/zip) as social engineering tools to deceive employees. Is this attack a lack of employee training? Fault of security team? How would you go about protecting against this?",
