Right when I clicked onto Chrome last night, Malwarebytes had a seizure, alerting me every time I made a new tab. I wasn't even on a website other than Google! I decided to delete my Ad Blocker and it did the job, until today when I went back on my laptop. I'm not a wizard at computers, but know what malware is and what it does. Does ANYONE know how to get rid of this or know what \"cosmeticsrc.com\" is?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yv16baua9di41.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a135b8fc2891dd921a2494401a47840465d864fb",
