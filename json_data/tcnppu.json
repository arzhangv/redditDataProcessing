Agent Tesla is a powerful, easy-to-use form of spyware. Specifically, Agent Tesla is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that exfiltrates credentials, logs keystrokes, copies clipboard data and collects images from a victim\u2019s computer. In recent years, the malware has seen a huge surge in popularity, and more than 6,000 nefarious persons pay subscription fees in order to license the software. \n\nThe malware includes a wealth of features designed to help it remain undetected by network systems and often arrives in the form of an email attachment.",
