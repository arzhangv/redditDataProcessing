Unfortunately for analysts (and the morbidly curious) the source code for most malware is usually inaccessible, so we have to make do with disassembling it (using IDA or Ghidra for example) to get a better idea of how it works. For Wannacry, the best (I can imagine) you'll find is the publicly available Fuzzbunch exploits it implements [(all of which are available on GitHub)](https://github.com/fuzzbunch/fuzzbunch)\n\nOtherwise, there are a few studies out there that look into the assembly code of some high profile campaign binaries and what it means (the bigger picture of what that translates to at a higher level).",
