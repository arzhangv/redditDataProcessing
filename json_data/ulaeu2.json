Thank you for being a good neighbor!\n\nI do have some suggestions that might be helpful to make things safer for everyone.\n\nIf you are sharing a link that's potentially malicious, the best way to do it is surround the period(s) with square brackets \\[.\\] or parenthesis (.).  This breaks the ability for some to click on a link and prevents the site from loading if someone copy/paste link into browser. If the person removes the brackets/parenthesis to go to the site, that's on them then.  \n\nExample:  https://disney\\[.\\]com\n\nA resource you can use and share with friends to get an idea if something might be malicious is to use Virus Total (Owned by Google/Alphabet)  [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) or ThreatMiner [https://www.threatminer.org/](https://www.threatminer.org/)",
