For example if I want to portscan, I run nmap and set the options I need for that particular scan (scan type, ports, aggressiveness etc.), why would I use your wrapper instead. I see your effort of creating a universal suite, as I tried similar stuff, but in the end your creating a less flexible shell. If you look at other projects of this type, what makes them useful is usually the integration of a database, e.g. you have a project and it saves the hosts and scans on these hosts, or you add credentials to a project and they are used in the scans for each system belonging to that project and so on. Hope this helps",
