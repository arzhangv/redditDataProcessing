In this video, we\u2019ll look at an unpacked and packed version of a very basic Windows binary. We'll compare the two files in IDA and note the major differences. Then, pretending the packed binary is malware, we'll perform dynamic analysis on the file using x64dbg, with the goal of allowing the code to execute until the binary unpacks itself in memory. Once unpacked, we'll explore how we can dump that binary to disk for further analysis.\n\nVideo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ml04jPMH3U\n\nChannel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/13cubed\n\nPatreon (Early access to videos and more):\nhttps://www.patreon.com/13cubed\n\nEnjoy!",
