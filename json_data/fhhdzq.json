As far as I can tell, no large packages are being sent by any unauthorized program, but some of my friends were suggesting I check since they supposedly got a miner from some of the same software we own, so I have no idea how to check/make sure.\n\nThanks, guys, apologies in advance if this is not aligned to the purpose of the sub.",
