I came to realise that it is also blocking all my investment websites that I use and charting websites. This is a problem as I am now unable to manage my investments from this device, which is a huge problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetblocker is set to run for 5 years and has a pre-made list of websites that it should block. I have contacted their support team but they don't seem to respond, so I really just want to find a way to fully remove this from my computer and get it back to normal again, as this is a big problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if anyone has any suggestions of what I can do, as there is nothing online that I can find at all and its really frustrating me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",
