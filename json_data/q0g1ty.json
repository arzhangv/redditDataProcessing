I would really appreciate if you can share your input on the sample and specially on file named \"power\" dropped after execution. It is maybe encrypted and needs the next stage payload to decrypt but i can be wrong.\n\n\nHere is the sample:\nhttps://we.tl/t-tS5ilb4xiy",

I'm not part of them so i don't have access to the report but i got my hands on the sample through a friend.\n\nAlso it's not a ransomware.",
