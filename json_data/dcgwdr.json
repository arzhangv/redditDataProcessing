        "selftext": "A few weeks ago, I got a warning from Avast about an file infected by Win32:Malware-gen in C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\\\[a8ce5182-f65f-4fc1-8730-4f90640f19e8\\]. The supposedly infected file name was {d4c1935-bfba-45a9-8be0-93873d77e298}.dll. I deleted it. The next day, Avast warned me about the same file again, so I deleted it. Every single day since, it's been warning me about the same file in the same folder, and no matter how many times I delete it, it comes back. What are some of the potential causes of this issue? Could it be the fault of sites like Vimm's Lair? Was it something I downloaded? OR is Avast being stupid or giving me a false positive?",
