The plan is to connect the laptop to my phone's LTE Hotspot and then let it infect. After infection I will show the ransom page. Mobile data is not a problem. Phone is running Android 7.1.1 with 1 May security patch (OnePlus 5). After the demonstration the laptop will be completely wiped. I want to make sure it does not infect other devices (as far as I know CRBR does not self-spread) and that I'm able to show the TOR ransom page. Of course, the ransom will not be paid. The only thing that is on the laptop are some random files downloaded from the internet for it to encrypt and the ransomware (already got a sample).",

Have two boxes running on the same laptop and create a sandbox (where they are connected to each other, but not the host machine) for the malware to run wild. \n\nHave one box email an attachment with the malware to the second one. You demonstrate from the second one that the email looks normal and legit (phishing), and then open the attachment. That box should display the ransom screen and the ransomware will scan the network, finding the original box on the same network and infect it also. \n\nSome ransomware require an internet connection, but not all (i.e. Locky Bart). I would refrain from using any form of ransomware that is not in an isolated network.",
