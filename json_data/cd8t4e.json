It is installed via downloading something else and will do so secretly.\n\nIt was made by Idld Buddy inc. and claims it performs thousands of calculations while your computer is in sleep mode. I deleted it by going into safe mode, and deletimg ALL of its files, then recycling the recycle bin. You need to do this in safe mode because you can't delete programs that are running, and you can't stop the service exe.",
