I know some extensions can do this (I think some AV extensions actually do it) but I can't really find out whether the most widespread adware toolbar did that as well. \n\nI believe the main purpose of this toolbar was showing ads, but from what I can tell, it may have been based on just the toolbar queries.\n\nCan anybody help me out?\n\n",
