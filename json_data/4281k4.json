The malware ended up coming back within a week though  and i figured i had something reinstalling it through a rootkit or something but i recently found this autoit script running in the background. I can't exactly tell what it's doing but it's definently reading/writing to an encrypted file\n\nheres the autoit code http://pastebin.ca/3344993\n\n\n\nedit: found some more interesting parts in the code. apparently it has an if clause IF kaspersky is running do this.( if the process avpui.exe is running)\n&gt;;~ If ProcessExists(StringReplace(StringReplace(\"avp^i.?x?\", \"?\", \"e\"),\"^\", \"u\")) Then\n&gt;;~ FileDelete(@AppDataDir &amp; \"\\\" &amp; $hJTiDIISINTVeDZaZZXLJNJdTPBGXNPf &amp; \".vbs\")\n ",
