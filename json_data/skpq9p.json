It is a particularly nasty ransomware encrypting all users data with a AES and RSA encryption as well as covers all of its traces and lock most functions of windows regularly used remedy the problem. I am currently working in a decrypt key. As we know it is found in the memory dumped the decrypt function is called. If anyone was infected and has locked file extension of .mkp let me know!",

After preliminary analysis, the code is rock solid and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any holes. They know what they were doing. They only way to decrypt is to pay and they are good about giving you the key because they went through great lengths to implement a decryption process.",
