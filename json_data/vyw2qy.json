If one does not exist you can write your own.\n\nThere is a pdf that goes over Linux artifacts and there locations.\n\nShamim also works on Linux now so you could easily install reboot capture the data\u2026 reboot again capture the data\u2026 and repeat as needed to determine what services start on every boot.\n\nMaybe even start with the Linux comparable for the tabs listed in autoruns. Map those and then sort through the locations on disk.\n\nSo even if one does exist you need to be able to ensure it is as complete and comprehensible as possible. Understanding how things work is harder but will pay back dividends in the long run.\n\nBest of luck with your research.",
