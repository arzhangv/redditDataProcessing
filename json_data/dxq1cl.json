I was like... \"hmmm, that's strange, I didn't change my default search engine\", after some googling, apparently this add-on was hijacked with malware. I quickly went to remove the plugin, which worked seemingly enough, but in the process it opened up a new tab with some russian language, I quickly closed it and made sure to run a scan with Malwarebytes.   \n\n\nBe careful, everyone.
