        "selftext": "Hi! Sorry if this is a strange question but I got some malware on my computer a few days ago. I managed to \"remove\" all the threats the programs I scanned with detected. \n\nUpon one of these programs completing a scheduled scan tonight, it detected two threats. One piqued my interest because I hadn't seen it before and it was in a folder named \"kuck\", which seemed insulting.. I navigate to my program files folder and cant seem to locate the folder, so I reveal hidden files/folders on my computer and sure enough, this was sitting inside.\n\nThe file is called \"swiped\". I am just pretty curious about what this thing does, but I'm definitely gonna get rid of it. If anyone could let me know that'd be sweet!\n\n[LINK TO THE FILE](http://www.mediafire.com/file/5dt89xzc91to1hm/swiped.exe)",

Also, there are sites conveniently listed [here](https://securityintelligence.com/comparing-free-online-malware-analysis-sandboxes/) which will allow you to upload raw malware samples and they will scan them with multiple antivirus programs and generate sandbox reports to outline the actions the malware takes (such as calling home, moving files, etc...)",
