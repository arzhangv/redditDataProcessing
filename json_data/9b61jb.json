You can certainly be a good malware analyst without those skills. Hell I don't and I've presented at SANs about malware I've poked at, but I'll never call myself a reverse engineer. If you really want to compete with FireEye you're going need to have the CompSci basics down hard and feel comfortable working at a very low level. Certainly something you can work towards, but it will be an investment.\n\nedit: words are hard",
