Redirections for Android devices were setup in htaccess, sending people off to a russian IP address. Also, index.php had been infected with base64 encoded code... It's that code that I haven't fully deciphered, even after decoding and googling.\n\nChanging eval() to echo() produces the following, but I can't make sense of the escaped and extended characters. Can anyone help tell me what this is doing? Thanks in advance.\n\nedit: removed the [echoed, unencoded/unzipped code](http://ddecode.com/phpdecoder/?results=c8a7100d88b3a90d0ac3947bfad1b09a) from this post, and pasted the raw code [here](http://pastebin.com/PLpTrg6z) instead, as that seems more useful.\n\nIt's really interesting to me that they've added comments that quote from [bloodcyber.html](http://www.megalomaniac.com/~andrew/funny/bloodcyber.html), but I can't seem to find the specific code on Google.",
