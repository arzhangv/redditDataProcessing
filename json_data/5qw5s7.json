Instead they are actually giving you something, a malicious attachment.\n\nWhat do you lot think, should we refer to these type of emails as \"Phishing\", \"Malicious Spam (MalSpam)\" or something else?\n\nI am probably overthinking this but i have had to correct so many people when they call something a \"virus\" when they mean malware. i don't want us to be correcting these people in 20 years time as well.",
