But in the doc, they said it only attacks the PLCs after those PLCs are proven to be the ones in the Natanz. In other words, Stuxnet won't attack a PLC device which is not it Natanz.\n\nHowever, during the balloon test(where they infect the air pump by Stuxnet and let the balloon blow up), the experiment environment was not the same as the Natanz facility. Why did Stuxnet attack the PLC which does not have the same configuration with the ones in Natanz?",
