Now more of a personal issue, but we have all made mistakes, I have made some very stupid mistakes very stupid mistakes over the internet, now here comes cringe, I got a contract for pro football/soccer and i am paranoid if I become famous a hacker has all my keystrokes and will expose me of my mistakes. I know the odds of being that famous is low etc even when being pro, but they said the same thing when i was trying to go pro but here I am :) I am 17 rn and well it just been kinda getting to my head. Some hacker is gonna ruin my life",
