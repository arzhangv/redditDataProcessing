There was two anti malware services that was running and I thought the other one was just some kind of branch service. The first one uses only 3% of my CPU but the second one used up to 60% of my CPU. I had it for 6 months and my laptop was in brink of being burned. Also, it uses a lot of power too.  \n\n\nSo I had to check where it was coming from. The anti malware service that uses only 3% was coming from MsMpEng.exe. The other anti malware service was coming from MsMpEngs.exe. Now I had more reason to assume that it was a malware. I searched it and had an info about it.   \n\n\n [https://virus-removal-guide.net/48786-remove-msmpengs-exe-miner-easy-steps-to-uninstall/](https://virus-removal-guide.net/48786-remove-msmpengs-exe-miner-easy-steps-to-uninstall/)",
