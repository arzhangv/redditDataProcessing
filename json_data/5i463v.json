Already, no users have admin access to the server, and IT admins log into their workstations with their non-admin accounts. I don't care about workstation (VM) snaps - they can crypto all they want.\n\nBut am I more vulnerable to a ransomware attack being able to delete the network windows shadow copies? What can be done from a server side to minimize this possibility? (I already have backups but those are daily)",
