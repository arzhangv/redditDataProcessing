Save files, custom content, downloaded stuff, everything. The game starts up as if it were installed brand new. I'm pretty hesitant to tell her because she spent a long ass time on those save files and a long ass time collecting all of the custom content she downloaded. The question I pose is, is it possible the malware removal process deleted all of that data? She hadn't started the game in a couple weeks so perhaps it was lost sometime before I cleaned her PC?\n\nPlease help because I'm fuckin scared",
