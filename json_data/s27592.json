One of the things they have is the advantage of running shared farms/resources to take advantage of economies of scale across multiple customers. Their pricing at rates high enough to just 'in-source' it not doing them any favors. They should capitalize on the scale and come in less than I could do it in house to get the sales. Even at the same cost, I would consider it.",
