I was trying to find where ShareX saves screenshots and stuff but that's besides the point.\n\nI went in my C: drive, Users folder then clicked on the folder with my Windows account name. There was a file, let's call it $name.scr (where $name was my windows account name). Nothing scary or something, the file was encrypted if I were to open it with notepad++ (it was like NUL NUL NUL NUL NUL etc), only thing I could manage to read was my password to my steam account and other accounts on different sites &amp; my dogs name. Again, nothing scary, probably the worst thing that this can be is a keylogger.\n\nAnybody knows more regarding this file?",
