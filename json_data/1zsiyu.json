Curiously going to this url in browser displays some js to the page:\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/K5g9Qt3u\n\nSome terms here look interesting, its defining the following things:\n\nblacklist_keywords, blacklist_urls, slider_keywords\n\nBy the way, visiting one of these blacklisted urls returns this:\n\nhttp://www.conversantmedia.com/legal/privacy\n\nI particularly liked where they seem to be using the NSA's \"meta-data\" argument here:\n\n&gt;At Conversant, Inc., or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including Commission Junction, Inc., a Conversant Company (\u201cConversant,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d), we provide online advertising services. To do this we follow information usage practices based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly.

This type of data includes things like full name, home address, telephone number, or email address.\n\n&gt;Non-Personally Identifiable Information (\u201cNon-PII\u201d): Information that cannot identify an individual person, such as IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity.\n\n&gt;Please take some time to read about what our business does, learn how we ensure that data you share with us is collected and used safely, and visit resources that provide more depth on our industry.\n\nSome of these naming conventions seem really interesting too:\n\nCATEGORY:\"sendoricategoryantivirus\nCATEGORY:\"sendoricategorybanks\"\n\nInteresting that the domain is registered \".com\" but they have no website up, and it returns forbidden. Also, I'm assuming that the server name stands for \"content-delivery-network\"\n\nLet me know what you guys think, would be really interesting to see some more experienced people's comments on this. \n\nEdit:\n\nDid some research by googling uncommon variable names and stuff, came up with this code, which seems to be related. \n\nhttp://pastebin.com/YQsbSShC\n\n\n\n\n",
