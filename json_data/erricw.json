For example:\n\n```c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"hello world!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n```\ni686-w64-mingw32-gcc a.c\n```\n\nThe resulting `a.exe` is detected as suspicious by 35 detection engines: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/504d75e616ae12011e14cfcbb16eb1f471ce0afdfe0a00c9e003cbed6fead319/detection\n\nIs it a false positive?",

We've actually been using it to compile our binaries for pentesting so this has been pretty annoying.\n\nYou can prevent some of the detections with compiler flags and other hacks but moving over to visual studio solves it completely.\n\nIf I remember correctly we saw the maincrtstartup created by mingw is detected specifically. In addition, some products flag on a combination of heuristics including dependencies that are relatively specific to mingw such as msvcrt.dll and not the newer Microsoft runtime libraries. \n\nIf you find a way to easily prevent this please do share!",
