        "selftext": "Hello. I recently took my usb drive to get a few printouts done from a PC shop. When I connected my usb at home later, it shows the space occupied by the files, but all the files are gone, and there is just a shortcut with the drive name inside. When I click on it, i get an error message that says - \n\n\"There was a problem starting /gIug.eGsKwO0cEqS4WyQsUm4W8kCoQCeGsUmEqIkMyaiKS6iKwYAmOqS4Y0cE0cOgU\n\nThe specified module could not be specified.\"\n\nCan i somehow get rid of this malware/virus and retrieve my files at the same time? Please help me out.\n\nThanks",
