Now my understanding is that one has to communicate with the service running on a particular port.\n\nThe malware is a decade old, and although I found plenty of details about the malware, not talked about which commands the malware responds to. I am assuming I have to send specific commands that the service responds to using nc or something ?\n\nSo is there any archive, where the detailed analysis of the malware is present ? Or some other method by which to figure out which commands the malware responds to ?\n\nThanks\n",
