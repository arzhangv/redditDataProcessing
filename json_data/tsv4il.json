        "selftext": "Hi, Reddit,\n\nDuring the project implementation for my bachelor's thesis **\\[1\\]**, a software (named dike, as the Greek goddess of justice) capable of analyzing malicious programs using artificial intelligence techniques, I was unable to locate an open source dataset with labeled malware samples in the public domain. As a result, I created DikeDataset, a dataset with labeled PE and OLE samples **\\[2\\]**. Because it was not the main focus of my thesis, the samples attributes are not evenly distributed (the benign-malicious and OLE-PE ratios are quite low), but the dataset aided greatly in the research process.\n\nThis week, I was surprised to see that the public GitHub repository (which was used only for storage, without any promotion on communities like this) gained some organic reach (views, clones and stars). Furthermore, I was thrilled to learn that it was used in a research article published in 2021 **\\[3\\]**!\n\nAs a result, I'd like to share this project with the community in the hopes that it will be useful to some members of the community.\n\n**\\[1\\]** [dike](https://github.com/iosifache/dike)\n\n**\\[2\\]** [DikeDataset](https://github.com/iosifache/DikeDataset)\n\n**\\[3\\]** [Toward Identifying APT Malware through API System Calls](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2021/8077220/)",

It's also worth noting that the paper is written in Romanian, as I found it difficult at the time to learn to write both academically and in a foreign language (in contrast to the master's thesis, which I am now writing in English \ud83d\ude0c).\n\nI used MalwareBazaar for the malicious OLE samples. The remaining three were not released at the time because I began my thesis study in the autumn of 2020. However, there is positive news in the form of new labeled datasets that researchers may use.",
