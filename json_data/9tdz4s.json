The point is that the only languages I understand fairly well are C &amp; Python (and other languages).\n\nObviously , I'm starting to learn ASM x86 with NASM as assembler.\n\nDo you guys know any good sites / books with whom I can learn how to understand and write efficient code in ASM from scratch?\n\nAlso , a knowledge of C &amp; ASM should be enough for RE, right?\n\nThanks in advance for your answers!",
