I thought Conficker would be a good choice to watch propagate but it seems to detect the virtualization and do nothing.\n\nI am looking for recommendations for specific malware that will propagate on its own (once an initial guest is infected) in a Windows environment and that doesn't care about being in a virtual machine.\n\nAny suggestions?\n",
