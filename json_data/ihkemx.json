Further, this scoring system failed the obfuscation techniques used in the apk. Our goal is to boost up the analysis for the malware analyst. So when analyzing the malware with quark, call graphs for every potential malicious activity will be generated automatically.\n\nQuark is also selected to present in DEF CON Blue Team Village, HITB LOCKDOWN 002 and ROOTCONF.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-engine](https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-engine)  \nOur talk @ DEF CON: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yFhNG2LN44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yFhNG2LN44)  \nCall Graph (obfuscated sample): [https://i.imgur.com/hdTbvuq.png](https://i.imgur.com/hdTbvuq.png)",
