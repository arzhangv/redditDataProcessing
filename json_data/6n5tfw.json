            "comment": "I will list how u can tackle these one by one:\n1. If you feel the computer is bugged, format it. Thats the best way of getting rid of a keylogger or similar software. You don't need to wipe the disk clean, just the partition where windows is installed and install a new one. Preferably one from microsoft's website so if your laptop came with bloatware, they wont be installed.\n2. Use a VPN or proxy. There are many free options available one such is Hola VPN extension. If using proxy be CAREFUL as some proxy's display the site you are visiting in the url, which will let your ISP know which site you are visiting since ISPs can see the website address you are visiting. My advice is, If you don't mind sharing some of your bandwidth with other hola users(that's why its free, bandwidth use is low tho if you disable it when not using) and want something free go with hola.(I have used it too, Also check for other alternative before using hola tho).\n3. That sucks. Talk to your parents man. Also put a tape or sticker on your laptop webcam.",
