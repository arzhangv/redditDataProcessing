I have always loved Lazy Swipe  and even recommend to my friends, NOW I've been having to contact my friends back and telling them to uninstall Lazy Swipe because of the malware that was added. \n\nI know, i know... it's because \"Our app provides integrated promotional opportunities to third-party entities with minimal disruption to user experience.\" - that is a total lie! the malware is very intrusive, tricking the user into clicking it's ads. With all the trust I've placed in them, i now am forced to uninstall Lazy Swipe due to the fact that malware is now on it.\n\nI also have not only had google chrome mobile tell me that the clicked URL are malicious, but my mobile antivirus as well, whenever the android scan occurs and/or accessing your app.\n\nI can't believe Lazy Swipe messed up this bad. All so they can make a little money. What about my privacy?!\n\nAndroid app url: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lazyswipe\nDeveloper: http://www.lazyswipe.com/",
