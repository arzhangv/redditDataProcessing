If you're an attacker, this means you'll want to encode data in a format that would commonly be downloaded to avoid potential scrutiny by the target. PDF, HTML, JS, CSS, JPEG, GIF, PNG, MP4, and so on. The list can get pretty long, there are plenty of less common formats that wouldn't qualify as unusual, but I would daresay the list of data formats that would arouse no suspicion contains less than 1000 formats.\n\nWould anyone disagree? This is a fairly small topic of discussion, but I need to make sure I'm on the right track with the hypothesis.",
