On my home screen an animation played that floated in an app with an anime character as its icon inside of a soap bubble. I didn't click on it and it disappeared by itself. A full size ad also played from my home screen which just started today. Now the only third party app that I downloaded was tutu and that was over a month ago and since I haven't updated or even opened it in over a month i'm not sure it is playing these ads. \n\ntldr; I got an ad for some anime app on my home screen with a bubble animation to make me click on it and a full size ad as well\n\nHas anyone seen this animation before and what did you do to remove it?",
