Also if there's a way to know whether it has infected my system or not it'll help.\n\nI did not open it directly but I dragged it into notepad to see the content, is this dangerous in any way? Need to check my system anyway if possible - I'm paranoid about these things.\n\nVirusTotal link:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/c46be1b3dd776bcb728469386fc03654efb4fd6226578f7dd86d1bc805842ef5/analysis/1481756599/\n\nI can also upload the file to a file-hosting website if needed.\n\n\nEdit:\nPastebin link: (the content of the file when viewed in notepad)\nhttp://pastebin.com/9XgJWHGG",
