While I understand everything written, I am unfamiliar with the different services, function calls, a bunch of other stuff is just outside of my experience. What should I be reading, or doing, as a primer to getting into malware analysis? At the moment, I am no guru, A+, Net+, some programing experience. \n\nThanks for any assistance or insight. \n",
