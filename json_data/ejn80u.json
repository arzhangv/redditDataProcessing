I'm not sure how many people know the total number.    \n\n\n'APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014. They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information that would benefit nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs. APT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various security researchers. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries operating in the Middle East; however, we believe APT34's strongest interest is gaining access to financial, energy, and government entities.'  \n\n\n [https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/07/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network.html](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/07/hard-pass-declining-apt34-invite-to-join-their-professional-network.html)",

Iran has supposedly targeted US banks, leaked email accounts of parliament members, and caused a wide scale power outage in Turkey (according to Wikipedia). The country denies some of these allegations, but this nonetheless shows the potentially dangerous attacks that could occur if an escalation in aggression takes place. \n\nLook up stuxnet to see how precise and technical cyber attacks can get. Also, look at how much Russia influenced the US political climate of the later half of the decade. Propaganda campaigns could be launched in conjunction with cyber attacks (potentially collaborative ones with close allies).",
