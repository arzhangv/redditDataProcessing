            "comment": "There aren't a lot of courses or books specifically on Threat Hunting, and to different people and places it can mean different things.\n\nSome places see it as e.g. IDS/ Splunk/ EDR review, while others see it as post-discovery investigation, etc.\n\nI'd recommend looking for resources (books and trainings) on Blue Teaming, Network Defense, and other defensive security courses. This will largely get you where the Threat Hunter moniker usually sits.",
