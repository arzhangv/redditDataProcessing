Everyone involved in this understands what it would do, and that I would not use it for malicious purposes. I compiled this code to a .exe and uploaded it to virustotal to see what picked it up, and since I uploaded it, there have been russian IP adresses (2 so far)connecting to the server on my computer that I was using to connect to my friend's pc for the demo. I don't know what to do, or if I can do anything? I can give more info on the code if necessary.",
