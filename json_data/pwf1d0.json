IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application\u2019s IFEO will be prepended to the application\u2019s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger  \ne.g.,  \nC:\\\\dbg\\\\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe\n\nFew questions:\n\nCan adversaries execute malware undetected using this technique?\n\ne.g.\n\n    C:\\dbg\\ntsd.exe -g malware.exe \n\nIf yes, does that mean that ntsd.exe pose a risk and should be blocked?",
