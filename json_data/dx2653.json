Thus, very little information has been revealed.\n\nHowever, based on my research and other non-official sources (OSINT) the malware of question in the attack would be Dtrack. \n\nUpon regarding about this, i don't quite understand how this malware would be able to infect a system.\n\nCould someone help me explain Dtrack? i.e: How does the infection occur etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome sources:\n\n[https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/](https://securelist.com/my-name-is-dtrack/93338/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you :)",

The process name is pseudorandomly chosen from a block of encrypted process names. The shellcode is responsible for injecting the Trojan into the selected process using a technique called **process hollowing**. Sample **f84de0a584ae7e02fb0ffe679f96db8d** differs however with the shellcode injecting the RAT into the loader's process space instead of the process space of the selected process. DTrack Trojans are capable of downloading and uploading files, obtaining system information, executing commands, entrenching files and archiving directory listings of volumes to a password-protected ZIP file. The Trojans contact the following C2 servers: www\\[.\\]totalmateria\\[.\\]net www\\[.\\]materialindia\\[.\\]in \\* katawaku\\[.\\]jp\n\nCreated by **X-Force IRIS** Last updated **Mar 18, 2020**",
