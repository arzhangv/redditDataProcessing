            "comment": "Most people get this wrong. The people behind QRat (also known as Qarallax RAT and QUAverse RAT) also make a packer called QRypter. Several blog posts from both amateurs and professionals keep misidentifying one as the other, when in reality all you need to do is unpack the dang thing to see the original files.\n\nThe sample you provided was packed with QRypter.\n\nAfter unpacking (left as an exercise to the reader), you'll find ANOTHER QRypter-packed sample (as well as the PDF shown when running it). Unpack that as well, and you get QRat.\n\nFor unpacking, get a decent Java Decompiler (I prefer Krakatou), a decent hex editor, some familiarity with Java and serialized java objects and proficiency in a programming language of your choice (for decrypting and ecompressing stuff). A Java REPL can be handy for some manual stuff, but after unpacking a few of these by hand you'll know enough to be able to write an automatic unpacker.\n\n",
