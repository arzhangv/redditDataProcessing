Happy to help. \n\n\n1st step is to take every possible route to verify it was your friend\u2019s account that sent the message\u2026 idk much about telegram from this perspective, but you should be able to look at the account and at least see if it\u2019s the same#/acct messaging you. \n\n\nIf it is, contact your friend from some other account and make sure the message was legit\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t, you have your answer.

Obviously they must of been compromised by telegram malware or some sorts. Considering they are probably infected, there has to be a reason and purpose to the group creation and image sending. Doing some simple googling, has shown that telegram malware sent via images is a realistic thing. This is why I have my suspicions.",

Otherwise knowledgeable people won\u2019t even look into your claim.\n\n\nJust so you know, having an image open on your device and exploit your system is much harder than it is to imagine. The very nature and structure of filetypes protects the operating system from this kind of attack. \n\n\nAlso on a semi-related note I had a college roommate who made similar claims (which I entertained with \u201cmaybes\u201d and \u201cyes it possibles\u201d) but unbeknownst to me he was in the midst of bipolar mania.
