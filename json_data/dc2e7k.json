The installer was weird but i was tired so i didn\u2019t think of it. It asked me question like age, gender, country, etc.. Of course i didn\u2019t answer the name, email and postal code but i did for the other questions. So after that, forge got installed normally (except it wasn\u2019t the 1.14 but the 1.12 so i started to ask myself some questions) As it appears now, i clicked to fast on the multiple \u00ab\u00a0next\u00a0\u00bb buttons and installed 2-3 weird programms. ByteFence. Drivers Tonic and something along the lines of WinShield. I still didn\u2019t notice it. Later that day, i noticed the ByteFence icon in the bottom right task bar with a red cross and thought : \u00ab\u00a0oh hey my dad\u2019s antivirus just detected something\u00a0\u00bb so I started the scan to see what was happening. Fortunately, my dad walked by and asked me what this was. A moment of confusion followed and only THEN did i understand that I f*cked up pretty bad. I don\u2019t even know what to do. Should I uninstall it or keep it? Should I kill myself or just live happily with it? Should I question my authenticity as a \u00ab\u00a0geek\u00a0\u00bb or is it normal to f* up sometimes? Please help",
