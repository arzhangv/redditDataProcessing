I run frequent checks on the system, it does it's thing, etc.\n\nUnfortunately no matter how many scans I run I still get redirects in my browser to advertisement websites for MMORPGs, fake Java products, etc.  My current troubleshooting methods have included restarting the computer to an earlier save point, starting the computer in safe mode and running Malwarebytes again.  I'm a brand new reddit user, and I don't know how to attach images.  I apologize.",
