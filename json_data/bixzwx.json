I decided to post an updated guide to passing the GREM without the course in order to help those who are in the position that I was.\n\nSomething that I did not include: Cybrary has a free [malware analysis course](https://www.cybrary.it/course/malware-analysis/) similar to some of the ones you'd see on Udemy. It's great for those who would like to familiarize themselves with RE tools before they begin to learn Malware Analysis.",

The practice exam for the GREM is easier than the real exam (not true of all GIAC exams, but I took multiple practice exams for the GREM and am confident in this assessment), but not by more than a 5-10 point difference. I got a 90% on the practice test I took before the exam, and scored an 81% on the exam.",
