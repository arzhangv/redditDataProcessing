First, you you have opened the pdf and your malwarebytes pro didn't gave any signal, might be it has not been updated the DAT signature/it is not running scans on ad-hoc mode/it doesn't have a detection at all for that pdf which you have encountered with!\n\nCheck what is the virustotal score. If that is above 10/56 or 10/60 we would worry a bit but below that noting much to worry.  **Trojan.WIN32.PDF.Alien.gen** is basically a custom name for Windows Defender, so in VirusTotal that might has triggered the alarm for you. So, ask your vendor(malwarebyte) to check the sample for you and update their malware signature in form of eDAT. Next, if the score of VT in &gt;10 and that is coming from known AV engines then go ahead and format your device for a clean start, and if those detection are form any heuristic detection, those might not be too much worrysome. Once you get the update on your AV engine that threat will be handled..",
