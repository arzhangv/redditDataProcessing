But doesn't this break the rootkit?  If it's running a thread that can't be hidden to implement a private scheduler, what's the point of hiding its hidden threads?  There's still a non hidden thread running.\n\nAlso, is the Clock Locking Beats rootkit implemented by m0nk (see link, start at 22:00) related to this rootkit?  They both seem to do the same thing.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/gKUleWyfut0",
