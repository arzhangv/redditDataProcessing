I have read a lot of job postings on the topical overview of day to day operations, however I do not quite understand how this generally looks without actually being in the field. If anyone has the time to fill me in on what you do day to day (obviously not going into too many specifics), that would be very much appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks!",

I've worked pure RE jobs before and it's...... **fucking BORING**, at least from my personal perspective.\n\nYou get given samples, prioritise them, RE them as much as needed to create some detections and move on. You feel like you're half-assing the job most of the time because you're just looking to create IoC's. Maybe 1/100 times I would fully reverse something to understand all aspects and functions of it, only to realise it looks like the other dozen samples I've fully RE'd.\n\nThis is just my personal experience and malware analysis jobs vary wildly. But, just be careful not to fall in to the IDA monkey style world.",

You've mentioned that you wanted a more research oriented position. These positions are typicality working at groups like Cisco TALOS or Palo Alto Unit 42. These are coveted positions, and will take a while to get there. Your best bet is join a SOC and become the 'Malware' guy, and learn that way. This is currently where i am at, im the Malware guy at my firm, but i do more than just malware analysis.",

            "comment": "I've done both malware analysis from the IR side and the threat intel side. If you're supporting IR you generally take the sample straight to sandbox (get context on the execution to make sure you're running it correctly with the right arguments). Pull IOCs, provide additional items for the IR analysts to pivot on and find more. They come back to you with more, rinse, repeat. In turn, you should actually understand what you're reading in a sandbox report at least, since that's your most efficient source of info. If nothing happens in the sandbox and you expected something to happen, you have to look for sandbox evasion, missing dependencies that the analysts may not have given you, or anti-debugging if your sandbox isn't the best.\n\nFrom the threat intel/research side you're looking generally for similarities between malware like genealogy, family classification, etc. You'll make a YARA signature on some unique items: strings, resources, encryption keys or (hopefully) some unique code bytes. With this signature you'll hunt for more malware, study differences and the evolution of certain samples. The goal here is writing a full report or article.\n\nAn advanced level goal for both types of malware analyst is to automate parsing the configuration data (C2 IPs, RC4 keys, dropped file names). If you're researching one family and it's variants you'll have a lot of files so it's helpful to automate parsing. In an incident maybe you don't have the time to write automation but if you can it could help.",

This is a fast-paced, heavily operational role.\n\nOther roles will be more research and tracking oriented. This will involve heavy reversing in tools like IDA, X96DBG, leveraging tools like Maltego to build intelligence relationships between threat actors. You\u2019ll understand what and why a piece of malware, binary, script or otherwise, does what it does. You may work analysis requests for other stakeholders and inform them of your findings. This is a research heavy, non operational role.\n\nThese are the two of types of analyst roles in my experience, with some in-between, obviously.
