Also, with that file is another text file named \"file,\" then the three alpha-numerical file which is a torrent file and last is another folder named \"Download\" with programs inside that are \"Fraps\" and \"winrar\"\nI tried deleting it in safe mode and I was able to, but after restarting back to normal mode, the files went back there. I tried force deleting it too and while I am at that window, I can see it one by one going downloading back to my hard drive.\nWhat is this program? I'm worried I could download harmful files/viruses in my PC. Please help.",
