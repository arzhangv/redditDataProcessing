This project is heavily inspired by Heroin by Runar Jensen and Diamorphine by @m0nadlabs open source LKM rootkit projects. Especially, the Syscall interception mechanism section was totally taken from Diamorphine by @m0nadlabs repo and rest of the functionalities are also the same but with a different approach: IOCTL.\n\nLINK: https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit",
