Great learning experience and you could learn some cool things you didn't know about the strain.\n\nFlash that BIOS just in case with a working, stable, version and repeat the experiment with other variant strains.\n\nI think it would be cool to do again on a slow weekend.\n\nBut, yes. The answer is yes. If you can see it and modify it, using the VMs operating system, so can your ransomware.",

It doesn't effect the day to day running of your device. That's all defender's job / whatever other security products you have. And as the ransomware is running on the VM and not your device, then most definitely those files are at risk of getting encrypted.",
