When you see something coming off the box which is not identifiable as being part of the reloaded operating system, that, by definition, must be something else.  For example, an attempt by the 'kit to reach a command-and-control server.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky",

Identical or more capable versions of Core processors are also sold as Xeon processors for the server and workstation markets.\n\nAs of June 2017, the lineup of Core processors included the Intel Core i9, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5, and Intel Core i3, along with the Y - Series Intel Core CPU's.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Malware/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24",

But also be sure that you are not just paranoid _and need mental help_. \n\nA root kit diverts the normal operation of the operating system. Usually at the level of disk access, or file access by programs. For a good rootkit this is very much transparent and thus hidden. There is software that tries to look up files in different ways, from low level (almost bypassing everything) to high level (as a normal program would), and report any differences. There are also programs that an check if your operating system runs in a virtual machine or hypervisor (e.g. something like VMware or VirtualBox, but more hidden). You may also be able to remove the hard drive and scan it on another computer that is already booted and running. \n\nBut in general, if a piece of rootkit is made to be hidden, it's hard to find it. You'll have to read up and build expertise, if you are reasonably sure you are targeted, and not just paranoid. ",
