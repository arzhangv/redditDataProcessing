However, the source code provides enormous   \ninsight into how the malware works for those who can program in C, but   \nnot necessarily reverse engineer.\n\nI don't get why they would say this. An RE would get just as much info from source code as a programmer would. Do they mean that an RE **who already reversed the binaries** would not gain any new info from the code?",
