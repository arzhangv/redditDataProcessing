I ran into lots of problems and errors when i was first trying to set it up, going mostly off of other people's blogs on setting it up as well that were from at least a year or two ago. Decided to write a post/tutorial for setting it up as well, hopefully making it a bit more noob-friendly. Let me know what you think.\n\nhttp://www.mal-content.org/blog/automating-malware-analysis-with-cuckoo-sandbox-part-2-setup",
