In terminal ... rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Spigot\n2. rm -rf ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.spigot.*\n3. rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.spigot.*\n4. Work through the browsers extensions (delete the ones you know nothing about).\n5. In browsers again, change home page back\n6. In browser again, change search engine, and deleted a \"Yahoo\" one that isn't official and adds a affiliate/refer ID (that allows them to have commissions?).\n\n'Malware Removal Guides' says this is a [PUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentially_unwanted_program) - http://www.malwareremovalguides.info/spigot-pup-optional-spigot-removal-guide/\n\nAvira AV (free) only detected ~Library/Application Support/Spigot/ApplicationManager on the second scan for some reason.
