When I was learning reverse engineering there where many moments where I'd hit a realization why C works as it does.  Its based on how the processor actually works.  That made it easier to look at the code.  \n   \nAlso it will allow you to write tight code with minimal added junk by the compiler.",

Go and rust used in things like backend of c2 server, can be used to  write malwares oc but not too common at this moment i believe. \nFor analysis you will need any scripting lang to automates things in your work",
