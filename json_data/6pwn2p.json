Microsoft claiming to offer end to end encryption, yet performing data analysis on conversations.\n\nWhat about claims that Microsoft is guilty of the very same type of behavior?\n\n&gt; Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world\u2019s largest software company, provides intelligence agencies with information about bugs in its popular software before it publicly releases a fix, according to two people familiar with the process.\n\nSo, let me amend your statement:\n\n&gt; You should only ~~install software from~~ **use** providers you trust.\n\nIf we were to take the statement at face value and consider the ramifications, the only reasonable solution is not to use software like Windows (honestly a no brainer IMO) or providers that siphon up data (i.e. every provider).  The justification \"if you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide\" being the most common is nothing more than the typical explanation provided by totalitarian regimes.\n\nThe end game of course, is having to disconnect yourself from all unsafe networks (any you didn't design and build yourself), build your own hardware, flash your own chips, and write your own OS to boot.  The majority of the work required is beyond the vast majority of people, and therefore out of the question.\n\nSince we can rule out eliminating all threats, it's a question of the level of risk.  Particularly with the anti-russia sentiment in the west, it would destroy Kaspersky's western market if they were found to be doing what you are claiming.  \n\nCould they be?  They absolutely could.  Just like the US software you're using, and the providers it's networked through *could* be doing so as well. The only difference is we've got *proof* one of the two groups are already doing so... and it's not the provider everyone is targeting at the moment.\n\nThere are some serious red flags concerning Microsoft's (supposedly) benign telemetry setup right now. There was briefly outcry about that - yet now it's quiet, which is interesting because if you dig into it you'll start noticing it doesn't seem to be quite as benign as they claim.\n\nConveniently timed claims about an evil Russian plot citing old talks which featured no hard evidence no less... that's just good old theater.  Look at how much of the recent articles and allegations are almost identical regurgitation of older versions. Regardless, that means one of two things. Either Russian firms like Kaspersky are just better at what they do since they've been getting away with it for so long (longer than US-based companies anyway), or as mentioned, it's a convenient distraction from other more serious issues.",

They either need to play it /very/ stealthily and never get detected, in which case you need to be of very serious value for them to consider doing something to you, or they basically kill the entire kaspersky trust for an operation to get what they want, and burn all that capability. So you either are again, a very serious value target, or they do it at scale, which would be cause for military response from all other countries.\n\nIt's the same trust you place on canonnical, microsoft, google, apple, or basically every software you use or install without batting an eye.",

Also I don't use the product or advocate it, I just think discrediting it is silly - for what it does, it is a good product. Trend, Kaspersky and BitDef are probably the market leaders if you discard the \"next gen\" stuff. Nothing beats not downloading pirated software of course :D",
