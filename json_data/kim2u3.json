For reasons, i must clarify they were pentesting tools not actual malware. \n\nSo yes even if VT says it's clean if you downloaded from a shady source, still be wary",

The anti-virus companies use services like virustotal to find the viruses that are currently being found around the world and those data files you download contain the signatures for those.  There are lots of other signatures that the companies have and don't send to home computers but are available under virustotal. \n\nIt is not uncommon to have files that do not get detected on your home computer but get detected on virustotal but the otherway will not happen.",
