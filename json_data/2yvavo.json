After logging out and logging back in again to inspect the process with Developer Tools in Chrome, it showed me it was accessing this resource: **WARNING: THIS LINK MIGHT BE DANGEROUS, I DON'T KNOW** http://conyouse.com/wp.js\n\nIn Developer Tools, it shows inside as having this bit of code:\nhttp://pastebin.com/aHNNhSDf\n\n\nHowever, visiting the URL directly has this bit of code:\nhttp://pastebin.com/NgZSRfAB\n\n\nWhat the heck is it? \n\n\nALSO, I was browsing the root directory of my blog and noticed a file name that I didn't recognize, and a \"date modified\" that wasn't similar to any of the other files. The file name is:\n    ssv3_backup_payload-ISLxVkS5cI.php\n\n\nI googled that, and came up with nothing. I then shortened it since the last few characters looks like some sort of variation or random characters and googled \"ssv3_backup_payload\"... and wow, it looks like this payload is showing up in a lot of people's error_log\n\n\nAny idea what caused it or how I can get rid of it? \n\n\nI did a whois on the domain conyouse.com and the person doesn't have Domain Privacy, is based in Uruguay, and has a bunch of domains that appear to have been hijacked.\n\n\nWhat can I do?\n\n\nEDIT: Looks like someone decoded part of the original code: http://ddecode.com/hexdecoder/?results=21e0485ff3d3ef13694c4c88e8fda7be\n\n\nEDIT 2: The following appears in my error_log:\n\n    1413250896: /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/ssv3_backup_payload-ISLxVkS5cI.php startup\n    [13-Oct-2014 19:43:22 America/Denver] PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: results in /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/ssv3_restore_payload-AI9VLg7iwj.php on line 239\n    1416045511: /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/ssv3_backup_payload-tNCpyoHAOY.php startup\n    [15-Nov-2014 02:58:50 America/Denver] PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: results in /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/ssv3_backup_payload-tNCpyoHAOY.php on line 243\n    1416045564: /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/ssv3_payload_extractor-RQHQOIPddu.php startup\n    [11-Feb-2015 13:22:12 UTC] PHP Notice:  Undefined index: sb_instagram_ajax_theme in /home2/myhostingaccount/public_html/blog/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/instagram-feed.php on line 214\n",
