It's not complete so if you want to contribute, I'll update the mind map.\n\n[Mind Map of Malware Mitigations](https://atlas.mindmup.com/kinstonian/cybersecurity/index.html)\n\nYou can use the [SCAMPER technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToRl9dp0MXA), along with my mind map to create your own ideas.  Maybe together we can come up with something new and I'll keep the mind map updated.",
