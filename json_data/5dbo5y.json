Most of what I found is online or requires buying a corporate license, something that I can not do as the research is intended for acedemic purposes. Mainly my search results have been proposals of solutions in scientific publications that cannot be tested. I would be grateful if someone could suggest solutions such as Cuckoo Sandbox or sources that list such software.\n\nThank you in advance",
