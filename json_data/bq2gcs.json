Great point though, if this actually gets funded and becomes a reality I'll consider a red team book and a blue team follow up series that targets a slightly older child audience.\n\nPlease do share if you would so this can get printed!

Now that I'm a dad, I love reading books to my son but want him to know more about what I do.  It's something I figure we can both enjoy and I can help explain the concepts at a higher level.   There are so many books about nothing, I figured this way at least people in InfoSec would get a kick out of it.  :)",

When they get older you read the simplified Definition of worm, and then the third step is reading the explanation of the worm",
