To do this, I'd like to get a book.\n\nI've been reading around this sub and other forums and the book [Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Dissecting-Malicious/dp/1593272901) mentioned in recommendations and generally seems to be the most talked about.\n\nIs this book still the one to buy as somebody who doesn't really have any previous with RE or Malware but wants to learn? \n\nIf it isn't, is there anything better that I should look into?\n\nCheers!",
