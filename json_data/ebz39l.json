With that being said, I was wondering if you guys have any tips on what I should be doing or things to be aware of in the cyber-security field? Any help would be much appreciated!  \n\n\nHere is my profile on Virustotal, where I comment on various malware samples: [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/user/win32kid/comments](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/user/win32kid/comments)  \n\n\nFeel free to browse through, as I (attempt to) identify various types of malware I find in the wild.\n\n*This is also my first Reddit post so, hi Reddit, I guess.*",
