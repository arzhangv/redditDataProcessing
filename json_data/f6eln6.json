        "selftext": "I got a number of detections labeled SEVERE by windows defender over the last few days. It appears there is something trying to open a backdoor being blocked. The reason I am asking here is because I am used to windows defender, but with the changed to \"apps\" in windows 10, the renamed \"windows security\" does not appear to have any quarantine option for these detections, and when I do a quick scan no threats are found. It's been a while since I have had to deal with a virus, and this sounds pretty serious. What is the best current way, I should be tackling this. as windows security doesn't seems to be handling it?\n\nThanks \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Details of threat](https://preview.redd.it/juj4ssjc7xh41.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2373d9f9cffcd6bbc619b2aa58a44dd879c2e664)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4uccgwh7xh41.png?width=452&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5515af2990a191787a3f9aae2c14eb8f74c2261b",

A web shell is able to be uploaded to a web server to allow remote access to the web server, such as the web server's file system. A web shell is unique in that it enables users to access a web server by way of a web browser that acts like a command-line interface. A user can access a remote computer via the World Wide Web using a web browser on any type of system, whether it's a desktop computer or a mobile phone with a web browser, and perform tasks on the remote system.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Malware/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Why , why are people UNABLE to READ...\nNext time ask elsewhere please.\n\n2) Ever heard of [Web Shellsl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell) ? \n\nI do not see any scenario where a web shell would be a threat on your computer unless you got a web server program (Apache most likely? Xampp for noobs/devs? ) where the webshell is installed.\n\nOr... There is a russian tool (forgot the name ) where you can embed php with scripts and run them as an exe... I am not sure it would work but..\n\nFile names \"Readme.md\" suggest they are readme files from GitHub repositories. Its just a name but why would they be detected as threats? Why would they be on your computer in the first place? \n\nI'd bet you downloaded some php backdoor for malicious purposes and are scared because your av flag them. I dont want to be that guy but if i am not wrong : dont play with things you dont understand, you'll get infected yourself.",
