Malware that injects itself into into legitimate processes via DLL. \nOne example I found was Kaspersky Labs:\nhttp://www.securelist.com/en/blog/687/A_unique_fileless_bot_attacks_news_site_visitors\n\nI am also trying to find some techniques that will discover the malware since most AV can't pick it up.\n\nAny info on this type of attacks or some examples would be much appreciated! Thanks.",
