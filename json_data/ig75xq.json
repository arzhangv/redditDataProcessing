        "selftext": "HOW?: I was trying to legally download Plants Vs. Zombies, but not finding any good place to download it, not even from the official site, so after googling something along the lines of \"Buy Plants Vs. Zombies\" I ended up at [games.lol](https://games.lol) (without realizing it) and downloading it and [games.lol](https://games.lol). I ended up buying it on Steam shortly after because I stopped the download in time, or so I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT ?: Every times I log onto my computer, it appears. It really overwhelms the PC, as it starts sounding like a jet engine every time it appears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP?: I've tried googling the answer, but all that comes up is \"Is League of Legends a Virus???\" posts by Karens on Facebook and Buzzfeed.\n\nI've tried looking for the files and deleting the source. When I thought I found the source, I proceeded to put it in the recycling bin and empty it. It didn't change anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPC?: I have a Dell PC with Windows 10 on it, if that helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf more info is needed, I'll happily oblige",

Worse case scenario, nuke the pc and reinstall windows. Keep in mind when you're backing up your files to install back into the new windows, make sure those files are clean and not possibly infected with malware (would defeat the purpose of reinstall if it just reinfected it all). \n\nalso, we talk about malware-related stuff around here, r/techsupport might be better suited for your post.",
