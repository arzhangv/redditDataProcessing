It does not matter how big the attack was.\n\nIf you know a business, or you are part of that business, please leave a comment with the name of the company.\n\nThank you in advance",

They\u2019ve already gotten egg on their face once (if not multiple) from the event. They\u2019ve hired lawyers to protect them from litigation based on the event. Or had invoked their cyber insurance. \n\nWhat would be a better candidate would be to interview researchers and those within MSPs who can talk much more generically. You can then formulate what they provide and what you research uncovers to potentially provide what a breach looked like.",
