And currently I have like 500 000 Samples already.\n\nSecond, since I have already a big number of Samples I'm looking for an intelligent way to select what samples I will run next, and for this I'm looking to the following information:  imports, suspicious sections, suspicious compile date and if the name (after the sample is identified) is known.\n\nBased on this last information I have a simple rating mechanism, do you think there is another information I should look for in Static Analysis to add to the rating of the sample in order to chose which sample should run next?\n\nSorry if I didn't give enough Information, feel free to ask something...\n\nKind Regards.  \n",
