I did a Malwarebytes scan and got a bunch of hits (I think 21) for the first time since building it last October. Does anyone know about this?  Foodlion made an [announcement](http://www.onlinethreatalerts.com/article/2015/10/4/scam-food-lion-is-giving-away-100-free-vouchers-at-www-foodloin-xyz/) that it was not one of their promotions. Can't really find any info on it and just found this sub-Reddit. Hope this isn't a user-end question, as I'm just generally interested in what the Foodlion.xyz scam is/was, and if it is even really considered Malware. \n\nTLDR: What is the Foodlion.xyz scam/malware",
