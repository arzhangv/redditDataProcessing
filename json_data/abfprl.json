(who woulda guessed) I have run multiple scans and got rid of most of it with malwarebytes, but there is this one that wont go away no matter what. It puts these ads on the side bar of youtube, when watching videos. Here's the link, you can notice all of the ads that aren't normally supposed to be there. is  there a really good virus scanner that i can use, or maybe a way to get rid of it, Thanks.
