Company is in U.S under Delaware laws when I read the terms and agreements, but website states out of San Fran/Phoenix. Also, is \u201ccertified\u201d by a company called Softpedia out of Romania to be virus and malware free. More than anything I\u2019m looking to some insight into this. Have an old IPhone 5s from highschool I would love to get some childhood memories from(prom photos, plus a friend from that time looking to get married and trying to find some old funny videos. If I\u2019m in the wrong place could someone point me in the right direction or like clue me into this. Thanks!",
