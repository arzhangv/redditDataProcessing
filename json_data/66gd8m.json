        "selftext": "Hello, i was asked by a \"friends friend\" to join a teamspeak 3 server to play a game with some guys. When I tried joining, an error message appeared saying\n\n\"Driver error! To join this server Realtek audio adapter is required. You can download it from the official teamspeak website here: http://teamspeakofficial.com\n\nI immediately got wary, the message trying to comfort people saying its an official TS website, also I've never had to download anything to join a server. When you click on the link you don't go to the homepage of the webstie, it immediately redirects you to a \"downloads\" pae and with links to the \"realtek audio driver mirror\".\n\nSo I searched about the website on various \"safe check\" websites. Those said that the server is 1 day old and from Russia.\n\nAny curious people that want to analyse the file you can download there and the website?\n\nAlso the TS3 server is 188.226.145.21:9987\n",
