Learn how this tool stands out from others in its category.\n\nAs a side note, this is not a sponsored video. I reached out to the author of the tool after reading about it on a forensics website. He was kind enough to provide me with a professional license to use to review the tool, but there is also a free community version which incorporates most of the same functionality.\n\nVideo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z98edP0ZD9o \n\nChannel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/13cubed",
