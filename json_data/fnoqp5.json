Here is the Virus Total report: [**https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41411fe02e7fd60b4728e8601860e125bb71850275a3175fb606a9de820d218f/detection**](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/41411fe02e7fd60b4728e8601860e125bb71850275a3175fb606a9de820d218f/detection)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can download it here: [https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/malware-analysis-center/downloads/](https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/malware-analysis-center/downloads/) the database of malware in the Malware Analysis Center is incredible, you just need to know some basic queries: [https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/searching/](https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/searching/) and create an account (just email [admin@practicalsecurityanalytics.com](mailto:admin@practicalsecurityanalytics.com), also can email if you have any questions). Also I would recommend installing this on Windows 10 because Windows 7 I have had some issues getting this going. I hope this helps. \n\n##",
