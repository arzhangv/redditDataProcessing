There would also be optional co-authorship available for the collaborating analyst or analysts.\n\n  \nThis research would be conducted with the academic supervision of respected academic authors in the field.\n\nPlease do let me know whether this would be an opportunity in which your company would be interested in pursuing.",

I\u2019m currently working on my master\u2019s thesis on malicious documents and would be graduating in May 2018. If I could help with your research I\u2019d love to. I believe I could be of asset to your project. Can we continue the discussion over PMs? ",

Do some actual testing of tools found in the wild and such and you'll be golden. I used to dabble in anti-forensics. I got out of it when I started finding malware samples using my PoCs. \n\nAlso, check out the movfuscator. It's the most interesting and probably most mind-bogglingly annoying anti reverse-engineering compiler available. ",

I think this could be mutually beneficial.\n\nI'm currently speaking to a few people from different firms about this possibility, but i've had a great help and response during my masters thesis from this subreddit so I thought i'd see if i can try and tap the network contained within.\n\nAlso love the name RijndaelM (AES right?)",
