As soon as I have opened it in Photoshop (pirate version, been using it for years), I got 2 notifications from Avast about blocking malware. https://imgur.com/a/kqWgd  (Yes, it's in russian. No, I'm not russian)\n\nThe link on the picture leads to a suspicious looking one-page mattress related website.\nNote: I did look for a mattress about 2 weeks ago and have visited many websites like this.\n\nCan anyone tell me what has actually happened and whether I should be worried about my credit card and have it blocked..?\n\nUPD: I also have about 50 tabs open in Safari.",
