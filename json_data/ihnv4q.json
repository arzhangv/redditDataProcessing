Malwarebytes should pick it all up. \n\nThere might be new services created that you need to look at. I\u2019d look at the Windows event logs for new services being created by finding the corresponding event number for service creation and searching around the time you did this. \n\nRundll32 is often used for bad things, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns\n\nYou may have badness in programdata, appdata\\loca, temp dirs. You\u2019ll need to sus it out. \n\nTbh, this is what you get for trusting things.\n\nYou also hack games online and make them less fun, so fuck you.",
