If you run the file through VT and 40 engines detect something, you can feel pretty confident that this probably isn't a good idea.\n\nIn the reverse, you run it and 1 - 2 engines say its bad, now you fall into the concern of are those false positives or is it just something that only those 2 know about? Every file you open has a level of risk associated with it. It's up to you to decide if that risk is worth taking.",

The first thing you should always consider is where the files are coming from, and from your own admission they are from risky sites.

Files can be left on the hosts hdd but that never needs to be mounted in the first place since you can just use a partition on the flash drive. The flash drive itself getting infected is the most plausible, but worms like that are pretty rare these days. It's always good to be vigilant, I probably just have a higher risk tolerance. I haven't blown my host to this point and I've been detonating samples of all kinds for over 10 years, I guess that's why I don't think about it. That line of thinking may come back to bite me, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't.",
