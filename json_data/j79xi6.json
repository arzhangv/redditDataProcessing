So I scanned it used a pro to help with that, moved it on a more secure host and wondering if it got cleaned.\n\nhere it is: [https://dronesgator.com/drone-laws-map/](https://dronesgator.com/drone-laws-map/)\n\nThing is, only SOME people see it, probably by IP or place they visit the site from.\n\nWould be a great help for some feedback!",

            "comment": "Wrong sub unfortunately. Still, your site is still heavily infected. Did you ever have a look at the source code? Check line 76 - a lot of stuff gets injected before WP Rocket optimization kicks in. Assuming that you are actually trying to sell drones and are not pushing the malvertized links, start by having a look at e.g. the header.php of your template. Do you have a clean version of the site? Roll back - and btw. the \"pro\" you mentioned in one of your other posts, they haven\u2018t quite got it right. In case the live version is the only one you got, you could indeed reach out to Sucuri (as mentioned in /r/techsupport) or start from scratch in case you\u2018re short on budget. Get rid of any outdated/unnecessary plugins and install a WP \"firewall\". Another option - go for managed WP hosting for a few bucks more and let them handle the security. Your site is straight forward, doesn\u2018t seem to need much low-level dev interaction, so I\u2018d say this might be your best bet. Otherwise your site will get infected over and over again.",
