When I went into the windows defender it found \"Win32/Tiggre!rfn\" it was quarantined but not deleted. Before the virus was deleted I completely wiped my computer and did a \"remove everything\" format. Now my mouse cursor slows down randomly and my temperatures go up randomly while the computer slows down sometimes randomly. How do I delete this if WD cannot find it, Malwarebytes cannot find it, and karspersky cannot find it either?",

You mistakenly ran a silent cryptominer, which will use your computer resources to mine cryptocurrency for the bad guys. It's easy to find these programs, as they will be taxing your cpu and are often run with specific command line arguments. I suggest task manager to find out which program is mining and manually deleting the program. Otherwise a fresh install is best. Let me know how it goes :)",
