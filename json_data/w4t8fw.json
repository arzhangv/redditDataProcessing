How do these work, where  can they be found, how are they    implemented and is it legal to possess  them? If possible, please    explain in simple terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.: I feel like I should add that this is just for fun and to satisfy my curiosity, not for malicious or criminal reasons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your help!",
