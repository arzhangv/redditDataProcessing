I found out that it had a lot of other software bundled into it. \"Driver Updater (Malware)\", \"Chromium (PuP)\" and others. I have a screenshot attached of the leftover junk that Segurazo left behind. It also hid windows files into it's folder so there was no possible way of uninstalling it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Edit: Yes, that uninstaller.exe program has the Segurazo logo. It's also junk.)",
