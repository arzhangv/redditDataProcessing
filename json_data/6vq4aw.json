        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nThis was previously submitted to /r/computerforensics. Over the past couple of months, I've created a series of YouTube videos introducing the viewer to memory forensics and Windows forensics. Topics include Volatility, UserAssist, Shellbags, USB devices, network adapter information and Network Location Awareness (NLA), LNK files, prefetch, and numerous other common Windows forensic artifacts such as AppCompatCache, RecentFileCache.bcf, Amcache.hve, and SRUM. I'm working on another Memory Forensics video now that will cover process injection/process hollowing detection.\n\nThe videos are non-monetized, and are available here: hxxps://youtube.com/user/davisrichardg\n\nBased on feedback I've received, this has already proven beneficial to people in the DFIR community. I hope it's useful to you as well.",
