Seeing as I am on a MacBook Pro, I was too worried about it. Viewing the bat file in an editor, all it was a link to FedEx's tracking website. Thinking there has to be more to it, I open the bat file in a hex editor and sure enough, there was a bunch of hidden links which would have attempted to download a file called WinHelperKB. Does anyone know what the purpose of this file is? ",
