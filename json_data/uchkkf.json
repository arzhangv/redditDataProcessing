Also, since that folder does not exist by default in System32, the target file is pretty suspect. My assumption is that the AV is right. Can you see that process running in task manager? If you can and you notice high CPU usage, it could be another indication that the AV tool is correct. Some of those the mining tools are modified to run up your CPU more when the system has been idle for a bit, so watching stuff in real time might not give an accurate representation of what the process is actually doing. \n\nIf you upload it to Hybrid-Analysis.com with the same filename, I can download it later, take it apart, and tell you for sure.",
