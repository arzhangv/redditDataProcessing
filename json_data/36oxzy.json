I've since done a complete windows reinstall with none of my old files remaining. I need to know if people have experience with this websites malware, if this malware is in my bios, how to further clean my computer, and if anyone was aware that this top search result website is complete lies and heinous malware. I never took actual documentation of logs or infected files found when first cleaning with malwarebytes and hitman pro. Though I was reinfected from hidden files every time I scanned them out.\nSymptoms: Geniusbox (adware)\nSetting up proxy servers\nRegistry errors\nPUP files \n\nEdit: Deleted website text tutorial due to formatting. The website itself is not flagged as a security risk so please follow the link to see the what I'm talking about.",
