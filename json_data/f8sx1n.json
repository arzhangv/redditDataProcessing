I think it has software that notices when I open task manager and just suspends because everytime, right after I open task manager it's 80% cpu usage and just starts instantly decreasing. Is this a thing?\n\n(This happens even when I'm not doing anything on my PC. It's a gaming laptop btw with goods specs)",
