I'll elaborate a bit more:\n\nI have a main.yar file that contains a lot of includes, the first being the global.yar file with global rules. Then there's a bunch of other includes as well. I guess I could rewrite them to just one gigantic impossible-to-read file, but then I feel like what's the point of including files then?\n\nBesides, it's much more like\n\n    include './rules/global.yar'\n    include './rules/utility.yar'\n    include './rules/misc.yar'\n    include './rules/deletion.yar'\n\nWhere global include global rules, utility include rules used by other rules, misc include various non-specific rules, and deletion include rules for finding files that shouldn't be recovered, but be outright deleted upon matching.\n\nThere's more to it than this, but that's the idea, and I've yet to get it working.",
