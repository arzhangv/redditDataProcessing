Not sure if I am in right location for this? \n\nWas looking for software to flash a microsd and went to a website that wasn't the \"real\" website. Downloaded the portable, which led to a URL shortener then an amazon server. I ran the software thinking it was the correct one (I am stupid) was \"Etcher\\_94570\" which spawned another service called \"HANGiBit.tmp\". It finally left me with a lnk file that pointed to nothing. It deleted itself as well after leaving the .lnk \n\nI did see that there was a lot of outbound TCP connections from the program but  I am still not entirely sure what the software did. I ran a full Windows Defender scan but nothing came up. Not sure if anyone has dealt with this before or if I should just do a clean install of Windows? Was it just a scan to see if I was vulnerable? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome procmon screengrabs  \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/euMQf3P](https://imgur.com/a/euMQf3P)",
