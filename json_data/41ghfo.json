During installation it tried to install 3 different programs that I did not want. I unchecked all the boxes for all those programs. And still, after it installed, I got some Pluto.tv crap installed that I never asked for. Who knows what else may have gotten installed that I haven't noticed yet. Running Malwarebytes right now. Avoid Freemake at all costs!",
