But I dont recall or even see reason why I would order something on a CD from there. Its white mini\\-cd\\-disc, It says nothing except 3192718 and rbeh\\-ug4j\\-2agr  \n\nI googled the later, found only 1 link, to totalhash seemingly. I suppose that link is legit and not a fake link. Did fast background check about  totalhash.cymru.com first. My antivirus browser extensien / VPN marks it with green, as safe link.   \n\nOpened the link, looks like some kind of malware. Can any one dig anything more of this? ",

The envelope type that I got, is typical envelope for small objects ordered from aliexpress or wish. Maybe they'd target Govt office addresses with white envelopes and home address with wish-looking package from China, would be the least suspicious way.\n\n4. Both were Mailed from same area.\n\n5. Attack like this is very low level though and there could be many hopeless individuals trying these randomly, the mystery is though how would they know to target my address and name, no other neighbors ect had similar discs. Maybe they actually targeted me, or they just pick random adresses far away from each other, so that no much talks about attack would emerge and no one could connect them as a spam campaing\n\n.\n\n6. Whats inside the CDs for gov offices and for me  was similar.  The fake content is was slightly different, but same basic idea, lots of Word Documents that could contain scripts potentially.",
