There\u2019s a lot that goes into monitoring these types of sites that a script won\u2019t just be able to do for you. \nIf your company has the budget and it\u2019s a priority for your company they should definitely consider outsourcing that to one of the established companies that do that work.",

It seems like what you are asking is how to find hidden services, so that you can scrape, which you know is kinda opposite the whole design of hidden services.\n\nIt used to be that you could run a malicious Tor directory server to snoop on requests and discover hidden services.
