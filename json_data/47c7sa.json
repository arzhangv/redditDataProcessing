We've also created custom Powershell scripts which crawl user drives and profiles for unwanted .exe files every 30 minutes, which helps flag files that our useless anti-virus software fails to quarantine.\n\nIt seems impractical to manually block the payload sources, looking at Locky alone there are a multitude of domains which you'd have to block. There are 14 referenced in these 2 articles alone:\n\n&gt;https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/locky-ransomware-encrypts-documents-databases-code-bitcoin-wallets-and-more\n\n&gt;https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/Dridex-Actors-Get-In-the-Ransomware-Game-With-Locky\n\nWe have 3rd party email security, and Outlook will block all .exe and .js attachments, but someone in our user base will be stupid enough to open a .doc and allow macros.\n\nWhat else can be done?",
