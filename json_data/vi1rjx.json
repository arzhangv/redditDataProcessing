My guess is it's a similar HTML redirect method using \"onerror:\" and redirecting you to that bitly link. Last one I got sent me to a Russian domain that VT hadn't flagged try. I bet if that domain was still active it'd serve some kind of web drive-by download that gets your cryptocurrency wallet credentials stolen.",
