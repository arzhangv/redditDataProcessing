Of course I noticed this after installing the software..\n\nShortly after, I got an error that Au_.exe had stopped working. Looked it up and it is supposed to be part of the Spyfalcon malware.\n\nI downloaded the file from here: `http://download01.logitech.com/web/ftp/pub/techsupport/gaming/LGS_8.76.155_x64_Logitech.exe`\n\nCan anyone confirm? I am amazed that my GData antivirus didn't catch this..\n\nEdit: formatted link as code so it is not clickable..",
