Here's what it does:\n\n\\-Spontaneously changes all my typing texts into ALL CAPS, or changes my numbers to the shift equivalents (i.e. instead of 12345 it would be !@#$%)\n\n\\-Opens a new window every time i click a link or click the browser button in the bottom bar\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni've already scanned using norton and eset using the free trial.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nany help is appreciated, thanks",

Databases can only hold so much information, and with the abundance of custom encoding schemes or obfuscation techniques, how are we combatting signature based detection? I know there's sandboxing, but well crafted malware can detect when it's being sandboxed, so it doesn't run anything that would compromise it. And if things are blocked in real time, couldn't some damage be done still before AV or antimalware software quarantine/block/remove the malware?",
