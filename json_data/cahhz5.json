        "selftext": "Hi, I have an idle buddy question. I've run both Malwarebytes and Avast antivirus twice after I downloaded some sketchy software. The first time they found something and I deleted/uninstalled anything they found, but idle buddy is still there. I've tried to uninstall it, but the uninstall wizard is messing up, and I can't open it, so I'm thinking that all files have been deleted, leaving it to be an empty shell of a software. Is this possible, and is idle buddy no longer a problem?",

This family includes browser hijackers, Bonzi Buddy, and a host of similar software.\n\nYou'll need to make sure that it is not installed as a plugin for any web browser on your system.  If you have more than one, check them all, even if you don't use one.  These applications have a habit of installing themselves in a lot of different locations.  You might get one, but it will \"restore\" itself from the other locations.",
