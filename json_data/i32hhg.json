        "selftext": "Hi thanks for reading this post, i'm 16 years old, and i want to be a Malware Analyst/Reverse Engineer, i did a lot of researches but i have still some questions about books and other stuff. Currently i'm reading \"Learning Malware Analysis\" by Monappa K.A and i'm finding this book reeally good, at the moment i'm at page 404/484, i've understand everything in general (i will read the pages that maybe i didn't understand after i will finish it the first time). For a better understand i will make a list of what i want to do.\n\n**Books:**\n\n\\[X\\] Learning Malware Analysis\n\n\\[\\] Mastering Malware Analysis\n\n\\[\\] Secrets of Reverse Engineering\n\n\\[\\] Learning Reverse Engineering\n\n\\[\\] Mastering Reverse Engineering (Maybe)\n\n\\[\\] Ida Pro Book\n\n\\[\\] Art Of Memory Forensics\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Languages:**\n\n\\[X\\] Python (I have also made a prototype of a malware, i will upload it on Youtube)\n\n\\[X\\] Assembly x86 (I know the basic thanks to the book of Monappa)\n\n\\[+-\\] Assembly x64 (I know some things explained by Monappa)\n\n\\[\\] (Question here, C or C++?)\n\n\\[\\] Various languages like: C#, Java, Javascript\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Job:**\n\nI don't think here in Italy there are these types of jobs, if there are they are rare or stupid, like one I have read or they are underpaid. How can i obtain this job?, i need to do something before?, i've read (and personally understand) that is the experience that matters, so i don't need to do something before?\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Mentor:**\n\nI'm really searching someone for talking, for asking questions, for helping me to understand, if someone want to help me i will be glad, someone that have a good teacher skills, and not writing with a weird english dialect. If you want you can contact me here on Reddit and i will give you my Discord.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Info:**\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/xH0sUpeabSM](https://youtu.be/xH0sUpeabSM)\n\n**\"Yes, i'm a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judjing people by what they do and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will neve forgive me for.\" - The Mentor  January 8, 1986.**",

If you have fun with those, consider paying a little money for a course like 0ffset's Beginner Malware Analysis course. I find when I pay (a little) money for something I'm more likely to complete it.\n\nAt any point in your training, check out MalwareBazaar and try to reverse engineer a sample yourself. Work with a write-up of a known sample or go from scratch. Learn how to use the main tools in a FLARE VM and set up a lab first.",
