I was typing in the url for github.com but I missed the o and this started redirecting me to random urls before landing me on the classic \"You've got a virus\" page with a popup. It took a couple tries to click out of the popup.\n\nRight after I quite that browser page I noticed my computer was going slower. Did I just F*ck myself with a virus? I put a fresh install of ubuntu on my laptop today, do I have to wipe it again? Could anyone follow that link in a virtual box and let me know if I'm at risk?",
