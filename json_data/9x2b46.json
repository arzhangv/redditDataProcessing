The volume of attacks was in fact pretty steady for a good part of the year, with regular campaigns coming out on a weekly basis. It was interesting to see the variety in mechanisms used for the ransomware which not only included self-contained binaries but went all the way to the use of scripts. As part of the research I conducted last year, I wanted to understand why there's such a drive and lure for ransomware, outside of the victims payment, as well as have some way of properly testing \u00bbanti-ransomware\u00ab solutions with an unknown variant. So to do that, I went ahead and built my own ransomware and drew some conclusions on why it became so popular. This talk explore the background and process used to build a live ransomware that I was able to use for controlled testing. To finally draw some of my own personal conclusions.\nKeywords: Malware, Malware Analysis, Bitcoin, Encryption\n\nThis article appears in the special edition \u201eIn Depth Security \u2013 Proceedings of the DeepSec Conferences Vol. 3\u201c. \n\nMore articles can be found at http://www.sicherheitsforschung-magdeburg.de/publikationen/journal.html#c362",
