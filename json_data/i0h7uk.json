            "comment": "Not quite, a vm (virtual machine) is like an operating system within an operating system (if you're familiar with Bluestacks and how it lets your windows/mac run android and use apps made for android). VMs (i.e. via VMware, VirtualBox, Parallels (Mac)) let you run another OS while running your normal/host OS. \n\nThe VM should keep apps running in the VM contained in only the VM (if configured correctly). So if you download something into the VM and it's malware, (most of the time) it will keep it from infecting your host machine. So you can just power down the VM, dump and restart it from the old checkpoint. \n\nA Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the usual sense is to allow your network traffic to go to another server before it goes to where you want to go. (In a sort of bad example) if you imagine your web traffic like you want to go to buy a pizza and your house is your host/computer, the pizza shop is your destination, you might stop at the nearby bank to draw some money out, you can sort of think of the bank as the VPN/server that your traffic goes to before it goes to your destination website/pizza shop.",
