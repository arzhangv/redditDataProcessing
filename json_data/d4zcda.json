This episode covers a trio of Volatility plugins that can help us establish a baseline for processes, services, and drivers. We\u2019ll use those plugins to compare a clean Windows 10 memory capture against one infected with malware, both based upon the same \u201cgold\u201d image (as we would likely find in an enterprise environment). We\u2019ll then look at a few additional Volatility plugins that can help us identify the malicious code present within memory.  \n\n\nEpisode:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1thWaC6uvI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1thWaC6uvI4)  \n\n\nEpisode Guide:  \n[https://www.13cubed.com/episodes](https://www.13cubed.com/episodes)  \n\n\nChannel:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/13cubed](https://www.youtube.com/13cubed)  \n\n\nPatreon (Help support 13Cubed):  \n[https://www.patreon.com/13cubed](https://www.patreon.com/13cubed)",
