I have been attempting to set it up using dionaea but everything times out when attempting any git clones that resolve to git.carnivore.it which every single installation guide seems to suggest. Does any one here know whats up with it or if there are alternate ways to install Dionaea? If this falls under more of a tech support topic, im sorry. I just don't know that many over there in /r/techsupport would really be up to date with dionaea.",
