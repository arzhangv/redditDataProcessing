Most of the sites I remember either are gone or they are there but data was last updated prior to 2010. When I search, I mostly get the old URL's and nothing current.\n\nWould someone please post links to places I can download daily bad URL's of infected site. I am looking for something similar to the following example.\n\nAS#, DATE-TIME,BadUrl\n\n\"281402\",\"2019-12-31 01:06:03\",\"[https://pastebin.com/raw/YF8FyTqr](https://pastebin.com/raw/YF8FyTqr)\"\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nKeith",
