This was my first SANs course, and I always found malware analysis interesting, so I figured to give this cert a shot. \n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts on the cert itself for breaking into the industry? I hope to do some form of malware analysis in the near future, but I feel like this cert is a make or break. I was thinking of taking a break and focusing on the skills first (samples, writeups, etc), then maybe going for the last attempt or maybe none at all. Thoughts?",
