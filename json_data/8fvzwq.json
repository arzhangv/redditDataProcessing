Should I try to remove this on my own with a guide or tool, or should I pay someone to remove it? How hard is removing something like this and what potential issues can I cause?\n\nHere is the site: https://www.enhancequality.com/",

You should update all of your plugins and stuff.  Beyond that it's possible that they dropped a shell or something to maintain a backdoor.  So the best thing to do would be to wipe out the site, or ideally the entire server, and reinstall everything.",
