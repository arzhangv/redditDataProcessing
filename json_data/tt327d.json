I added a non-root firewall app that allows me to see what is being requested, but I don't have any affirmative hits. I confirmed the time on both systems is under a second apart. \n\nI started checking the domains and while they look bad they really arent on many lists as known-bad. But I see it try only twice a day, which makes it even more suspicious. \n\nSuggestions?  \n\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/uBnSExL.png](https://i.imgur.com/uBnSExL.png)  \n[https://i.imgur.com/uQiUQul.png](https://i.imgur.com/uQiUQul.png)  \n[https://i.imgur.com/2AX0wmT.png](https://i.imgur.com/2AX0wmT.png)",
