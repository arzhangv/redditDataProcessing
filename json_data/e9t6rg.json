Though, even that is vauge (and kinda dumb because what type of serious botnet doesnt use TLS or some encryption scheme for C2...other than the for the shitty one's I've programmed? lol). I mean I doubt they logged in to your machines and scanned them as they would need credentials or to be hacking you. So the most that can be said is they saw something coming out of your  ports.  I'd ask for what hours and what source ports and dst remote addresses it they have and see if you can verify his yourself. But yea shady....man",
