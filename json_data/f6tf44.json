I accidentally clicked on the email attachment on Gmail which showed the \"receipt\"( it was in PDF preview. I didn't download the image). After restarting Gmail I went to find the email but it disappeared. \n\nWhat are the chances that my phone got infected with malware?( I read online about how the picture contains the virus smth like that)\n\nWhy did the email disappear after being read?\n\n[TL:DR] : opened an attachment of a potentially malicious email and now paranoid as hell.",

I sometimes catch spam emails hanging out for a while in my GMail inbox before the spam recognition algorithms have time to kick in and move it to the spam folder.\n\nIt is *possible* that the PDF could contain a zero-day, but this is quite unlikely. Most likely the attack scenario is that they are trying to phish you, in which case you are safe just by not reacting to the spam.",
