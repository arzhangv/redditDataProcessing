I do not know why the creator of this worm is checking if people are apart of certain networks. All in all the worm itself doesn't seem malicious other than it's spreading itself.\n\nWhen you install the APK it requests the following permissions: \"android.permission.READ\\_CONTACTS\", \"android.permission.SEND\\_SMS\", \"android.permission.READ\\_PHONE\\_STATE\", \"android.permission.ACCESS\\_COARSE\\_LOCATION\", \"android.permission.ACCESS\\_FINE\\_LOCATION\".\n\nFrom there it displays one(Don't actually know if its one) video ad from the ad provider AppLovin. While its doing all that it gets all the contacts phone numbers and checks whether or not the person is a part of the [JIO network](https://www.jio.com/) through an api that they have.\n\n~~It also sends the phone numbers it gets a specific phone number that is encrypted with tripleDES(lol) so I'm currently trying to get the phone number its all being sent to.~~\n\nThe apk itself isn't really obfuscated for an android app ~~and it has quite a bit of personal info, namely the developer bundle(com.name.thing) has the persons name in it I think?.~~ So I thought the developer bundle id or w/e was the persons actual name but it turns out that ben stokes is a famous cricket player lol.\n\nInteresting thing is that the app is designed to spread the apk in order to find people who support chinese apps and then I guess they are going to do something with the phone numbers of the people that tried to sign in, into what they thought was tiktok.\n\nI'm currently trying to pull the ~~number~~ that is encrypted from the app, going to be using frida to get it probably.\n\nI was wrong about the encrypted part being a phone number, I initially thought it was a phone number because I read a variable incorrectly, the encrypted string `xejgFDJopbKApWH14X1D2VYpVmIzkO6dfEmBm2BmQS2PjY4/z7ly2magueQLl5Lxdiodz4lmlBXu9UQ6pBXE/stzfTMA21Y2Py8hJiItTSi1tgOUbL+2FuBjdoCL+/VY/2zQq5eF6EOfrE/IZOkA7naQof8Plnj/FJtbWLCvk7uj2DVdLFAXJcxRI5nnJudBH7wFTqXwcvWM1Piw6mMqUw==` is actually just the initially wormed message which is just\n\n    Enjoy Tiktok Videos and also make Creative Videos again.\n    Now Tiktok is only Available in (Tiktok pro) So Download from below.\n    \n    Link: REMOVED BC VIRUS\n\nif anyone is interested.",
