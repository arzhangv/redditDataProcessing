If something is going on you'll generally find out within like 10-20/30 minutes depending on how often you check twitter. Depending on how \"complex\" the malware/ransomware, etc is people start coming out with \"reports\" and their analysis of it anywhere from later on in the day to a few days later. \n\nMalwareHunterTeam (@malwrhunterteam ) is always posting or retweeting the latest things they've found in the wild, with some info/analysis or IOC's.\n\nI've recently started personally using [any.run](https://any.run) to play around wiith interactive malware analysis online (for free, although they will be  coming out with paid plans). I mention them because they have a \"Public Submissions\" section which you can lurk. There are uploads every few minutes, sometimes more- sometimes less.. But it's not too crazy. You could check out malicious/suspicious uploads and see what's going on. I'm not sure if you can download the original files, but you get a pretty good amount of info. I guess it's good to know what other people are seeing. I know virustotal has their professional/paid accounts and I'm not really sure what that entails but you might be able to get samples through them. Not sure if that's your thing but figured i'd through my ideas out there.\n\nHope i could be of some help.",

The guys who taught the course were talking about how it's kind of a boring time in terms of malware diversity, specifically related to exploit kits. Right now the majority of the stuff out there is either APT related wizardry, or coin miners. Even ransomware is becoming less popular these days, in favor of crypto mining hijackers. Evidently its more profitable for malware authors to make money by hijacking CPUs to mine crypto than it is to rely on ransoms. That may change though with bitcoin being a less than stellar performer lately. ",
