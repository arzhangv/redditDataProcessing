By being accurate about malware detection in crack tools etc, vendors would assist you in finding the clean ones.\n\n* Using crack tools and the like is risky because a lot of them are indeed infected and then you might blame the AV for it. So the vendors don't want you to use them at all.\n\n* AVs produce and sell software, so they don't like tools and crack software because they want you to pay for their product.\n\n* It makes a lot of unnecessary work. People tend to send in these files very often to get an accurate analysis for illegal software. They usually just get the answer that they aren't supposed to use these tools in the first place.\n\nSo yes, most of the time these tools are handled as \"don't care\". Don't care if detected.

If you want to break copy protection, do it yourself, and you might become good enough to get hired by us :)\n\nIf you want tailored protection, then you have to buy either EDR, ie. modern AV+behavioral analysis, but but managed detection service. But both of these are high end services and solutions, and thus out of reach for consumers.\n\nSource: Been in the business so long, and if I would type exact number of years, quite many oldtimers could figure out who I am just by that :)\n\nEdit: Even as we so smile on people learning cracking and hacking, any history of illegal operations makes you immediately impossible to hire.
