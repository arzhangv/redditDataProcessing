Child processes, logins, and network activity to Microsoft IP space would be indicators. Sysmon data could really help here. You could configure the Windows Firewall to log all traffic to/from those binaries. If they're implants, they'll call back eventually and you catch the callback.\n\nYou could also dump it in a sandbox such as Cuckoo and see if it does anything suspicious. Those are pretty trivial to bypass these days though.",

            "comment": "There are two types of digital signatures: (1) Authenticode and (2) Catalog. Authenticode signatures are embedded in the files themselves and go with the executable, which is convenient as defender because it is easier to validate. Catalog signatures are stored in the System Catalog Database. It loads digitally signed .cat files containing file hashes from the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\CatRoot\\\" directory. Catalog signatures basically say that here is a collection of file hashes that you can trust. Microsoft tends to sign a bunch of their stuff this way. It can be annoying at times because if you pull back a file to your local system for analysis, you can't verify the authenticity of the file because the catalog signature is sitting in the remote system, and your local Windows box doesn't have that file hash in it's catalog for whatever reason.",

            "comment": "These core system binaries that MS publishes with their OS &amp; Software like Office, Outlook, etc typically do not carry a digital signature like a signed executable. For ex., the command line (cmd.exe) does not carry a signature in the exe header. They are purposely built this way as other programs (benign or malicious) should not be running as a trusted process under the disguise of Microsoft\u2019s signature certificates. However the registry has details to attest to the validity like the digital signatures would normally. Hope this helps!",
