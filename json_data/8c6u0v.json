The thing likes to close chrome when i search things like \"reset\" or \"adware\" because its made so that you cant find out how to fix this using this pc. I haven't found anything on my phone about this, and it randomly opens really random tabs like amazon home page, or some russian dating site, i mean, amazon home page? lmao, anyways if anyone has any idea what so ever please help me out, the virus can be found if you search \"mail.ru malware\" and i tried the normal anti virus stuff, mcaffe &amp; malware bytes and did a restore of chrome, i even went through all the files edited from yesturday and deleted suspicious things, and went through my regedit and got everything with the word \"mail.ru\" in it.\n\ni appreciate any help :)",
