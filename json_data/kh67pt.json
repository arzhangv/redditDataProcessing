Also done full virus scans etc of course and nothing detected on any of my drives.\n\nI did a bit of research and it appears this IP may be associated with the Dridex malware, it seems very odd that I'm getting these outbounds now and again through chrome - has anyone else noticed outbounds from this IP via chrome as well?",
