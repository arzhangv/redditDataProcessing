I immediately quarantined it and deleted it.  I tried googling Ransom.BSM, and searching on /r/Malware, but nothing came up.  Did I just avoid the next big ransomware attack or something?",

As people have mentioned, this is a very standard classification for Anti-malware developers to know what type of malicious software you are dealing with. Ransom.BSM looks like Ransomware family malware. I am happy you avoided such issue. If it happens next time, make sure to get the logs or a screenshot, would be nice to know what we might be dealing with!",

There's so many different random pieces a malware that not all are given unique names and files that show characteristics of a certain class will get labeled with a generic name.
