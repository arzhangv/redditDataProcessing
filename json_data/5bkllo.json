I could use some help figuring this out.\n\nWhen checking in on my router logs (mainly out of boredom) I noticed that its been reporting DoS attacks once every few hours, always from an internal IP address, and always a \"DoS Attack: Smurf\".\n\nHere's an example:\n\n[DoS attack: Smurf] attack packets in last 20 sec from ip [192.168.1.10], Sunday, Nov 06,2016 20:39:09\n\nSo, what do? The most recent one was from my PC, while using it. I've done a full system scan with MBAM and my antivirus, including option for rootkits. Could this be a malware situation? All results were negative.\n\nIs something on my network attacking something else within the network for some reason?\n\nAny help would be appreciated! I'll provide more info if needed.\n",
