CTFs are fun and all, but even if you suck at them, don't worry. I suck really badly at CTFs and I'm somewhat good at my actual RE job ;)\n\n&gt;Are certs worth it?\n\nI don't have any and I managed to get a job. I know people who have them and they were happy with the stuff they've learned. However, certs tend to be expensive, so the best way to get them would be to find an employer willing to pay for them.\n\nAs other said, malware analysis is mostly about experience. I started out by reverse engineering random samples and writing about them.\n\nIf you have some more questions, feel free to DM me.",

            "comment": "Others may have different thoughts on the matter but I don't think it's out of line to ask the employer in your interview if they have opportunities for growth or an education budget. They probably wouldn't offer to pay for education right away but maybe after 6 months/a year and then they may want you to work a year or so afterward for compensation but you would clarify that with your manager before signing up for the class. \n\nAnother thing that can help your resume, depending on where you live, is if you find a place that can get you a clearance. If you get into work with gov contractors a lot of them want an active clearance even if they rarely touch classified materials so having one can open up your options and looks good even to places that don't require it.\n\nKeep in mind, for you own professional/financial growth, it isn't ideal to stay in any one place too long because it limits your pay potential. Often in bigger companies, even with your best effort and a great manager review, your annual raise will be capped at maybe 5%(?) with 3% being average, unless you get a great manager who can help get you past those limits or get you off-schedule raises. You also don't want to bounce around so much that potential future employers question your motives/devotion, it's a balancing act. All of that to say: if you don't like your first job (which I expect you won't because Tier 1 sucks) but they can help you get a cert and/or boost your resume and get you that \"CyberSec experience\" everyone desperately craves, you're not married to the company. No one in the industry would look down on you for wanting to grow out of a Tier 1 role.",

If you can score a job with an education budget you might be able to get your employer to pay for it for like a 1-2 year commitment which is way worth it IMO. \n\nAlso, coming out of school with a CS degree and a basic understanding of static analysis and experience with tools would be enough to get a second look for a tier-1 analyst everywhere I've worked or interacted with. Tier 1 in some places is basically a ticket monkey; looking at SIEM alerts, doing superficial analysis, making tickets if necessary, and escalating. Obviously this is not what you want to end up doing but it's *highly* unlikely someone will take you on as an upper tier analyst and let you focus on malware without prior SOC experience or a really impressive resume of technical experience. \n\nIf you want to go the SOC route, I'd say look for a Tier 1 position at a place that does malware analysis and has chances for \"upward mobility\" (though that may be a lie). Some places have Tier 1 doing basic dynamic analysis, other places have that at Tier 2 with static and RE coming at Tier 3. If you get into an office like that you may be able to shoulder-surf and learn from the upper tier analysts and get the company to pay for your certs which is what I did.",

It will give you the solid foundation you need to take your RE to the next level. Also provides for a bit of pre-knowledge before doing the courses. \n\nAlso consider doing Kaspersky training YARA hunting and Malware Rev. both are extremely hands on (better so than SANS its precooked stuff) and costs a fraction of those expensive courses. You can do both for the price of a SANS and have plenty left for a luxury vacation. \n\nCerts are definitely worth having but proven XP more so. Writing documentation and sharing your work is a big part of full time RE jobs. Write a few blogs on your analysis of samples you are doing!\n\nJob wise, you can look at requirements at the big AV and Cyber security vendor/consultant job websites. \n\nHappy hunting :)",
