            "comment": "Depending on the endpoint and network protections (i.e. not doing NGF deep packet inspection type ssl stripping) then doing something encrypted like ssh/sftp/https would probably work fine. maybe encode (base64 or other) the data so it's not just straight SSNs or whatever going across the wire. If you want to be sneakier and they allow outbound ping (ICMP) or DNS then you can make a covert channel over either protocol. Good luck!",
