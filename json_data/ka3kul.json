(so say a vm is active and it non-zero thusly al is set to 1). \n\nWhy does it later `cmp eax, 1` then. this would mean 1 - 0 equals 1 thus ZF =0, but a CF=1. So then when `setz al` is called then al is equal to 0.\n\nIs this interpretation correct? If so what was the point of this? Shouldnt it have been finished after the first cmp\n\nCheers",
