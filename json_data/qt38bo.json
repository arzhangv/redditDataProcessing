There are tons of examples on these sites, or upload your own if you\u2019d like:\n\nhttps://app.any.run\n\nhttps://www.hybrid-analysis.com\n\nhttps://virustotal.com\n\nFor static analysis, here is an overview of techniques:\n\nhttps://www.n-able.com/blog/malware-analysis-steps\n\nFor malware *traffic* analysis and to get your hands on some real-world pcap (as well as the actual malware samples that caused the malicious traffic shown the pcaps) check out https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net\n\n[Malware traffic analysis exercises](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net)\n\n[Malware traffic analysis tutorials](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/tutorials/index.html)\n\nThe password for all of the .ZIP files on that site is \u201cinfected\u201d. Just be careful with the actual malware samples, they\u2019re dangerous! Opening the PCAP in WireShark isn\u2019t dangerous, but for the actual malware you always want to work in a VM / sandbox if you\u2019re doing anything other than looking at the code in a text editor. I recommend saving malware files as plain .txt documents when possible. Using console.log (in a VM/Sandbox, of course) is another way to see what behaviors a piece of malware code is capable of; malware is often intentionally obfuscated making static analysis difficult.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",
