A funny anecdote he made was that in translating a RAT from Chinese into English one of the literal translations was \"leaky chicken\".  It turns out that the intended translation is something like \"exploited computer\".  Could someone who is fluent in both English and Mandarin comment on this and give me some insight?  Many thanks!",
