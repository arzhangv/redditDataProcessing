Once you install the AVs in the VM, you can just download a bunch of malware from virusshare or any similar website and just scan the whole directory. Doing that using multiple AVs on a directory with lets say 10k malware samples, you can probably figure out which AVs will miss which malware samples. ",

E.g. CreateSnapshot32, processFirst, ProcessNext (enumerating running processes), virtualAllocEX (maybe process injection), NTUnmapSection (maybe hollowing), sleep and so on. \n\n\nGood luck. \n\nThe formatting of this might turn out garbage, 10/10 phone skills.
