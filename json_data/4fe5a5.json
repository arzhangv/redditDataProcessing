I do not want to use third-party online applications for this\n\nDo I download the website files, once or twice a week and perform malware scans?\n\nI am more interested in the techniques used for scanning web applications for malware etc. \n\nPlease advice. Cheers.\n\nP.S: If this is the wrong subreddit, kindly please let me know where to appropriately post this. Thank you. ",
