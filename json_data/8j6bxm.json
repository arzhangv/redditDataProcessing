I've only found maybe a handful of samples with the IRC server C&amp;C  still live.\n\nDoes anyone happen to have a list of hashes for this family (preferably past few months), and/or IOCs for the Phorphiex IRC bot C&amp;C servers being used?\n\nTypically it'll be TCP traffic on port 5050 following a GandCrab infection.. Also if anyone knows of other ports used that'd be fantastic as well ",
