I need to emphasize again that I am not an expert on Malware. I am just a long time hobbyist. I hope that when I talk about it I have people giving feedback in-real time, asking questions, contributing, and if I am wrong about anything- correcting me.\n\nI don't know what to talk about or where so I will let you guys decide.\n\n- What should I discuss? http://www.strawpoll.me/14059225\n\n- Where should I discuss it? http://www.strawpoll.me/14059229\n\n- When should I talk? http://www.strawpoll.me/14059245\n\n- My previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/73q1oq/thinking_about_doing_a_twitch_stream_or_something/\n\nLeave a comment if you want to add anything else / everything else. I appreciate everyone who is willing to pay attention and share info with others!",

So you get a nice streaming tl;dr -\n\n**Software**\n\n[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) - Free, open source, streaming and screen recording.\n\n[Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) - Paid, a little simpler, good for screen recording (fine if you're just uploading to Youtube).\n\n**Mic** \n\nConsensus is to get a [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Silver/dp/B002VA464S). Get a pop filter, mic stand, and a shock mount to reduce ambient noise / vibrations coming through your desk.\n\n**Recording**\n\nRecord a lower resolution portion of your screen (e.g. 1280x720). This will make your videos way more legible. I usually set my monitor resolution (from 2560x1440) to 1920x1080, then record a 1280x720 portion of that. \n\nRemember to speak slowly, use the tone of your voice, and enunciate.",
