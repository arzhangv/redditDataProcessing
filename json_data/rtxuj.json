I just finished creating two virtual machines (1 XP, 1 Win 7) on a quarantined machine with the intent of loading malware to practice removal.  \nI understand but underestimated the difficulty of actually finding maleware to download.  I had seen a youtube video of a gent with a zip of 150 assorted pieces of malware and a list of certain known infected urls.   This is exactly what I am looking for.  Rouges would be great but really nasty rootkits would be more challenging.  \nAgain I understand the fact that this is uncommon knowledge and I can provide my credentials to parties willing to grant me access to their ftp or email me a zip.  Let me know if I am out of line asking this here or if it makes you feel better, respond in a pm.  \nThank you for your time.",
