I use my mega account just for sharing that type of stuff, so when asked and given a sha256 that is available as a report on Hybrid-Analysis (in this case it is not), I will download the sample using my access, then upload the archive to mega and share the link with the person who requested it. Any file sharing service would work the same way e.g. Dropbox",
