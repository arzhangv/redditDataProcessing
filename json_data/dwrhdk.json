Statistically in average it takes 90 days that respond to an incident, but given that's around what most organizations retain in logs, it is probably much higher.",

The alert was the result of the intruder creating a data archive file that had grown so large that a hard drive ran out of space.\n\n\nLOL the hacker had so much time they made themselves a little home in the server.",
