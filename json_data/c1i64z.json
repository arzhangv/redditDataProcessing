I have signed up with my school email and submitted the vetting information but unsure of how long it will take and I am running out of time, can anyone with a virus total or hybrid analysis account that can download samples please provide me with the sample for enCstrings.exe (its from a malware analysis crash course lab resource), I would be FOREVER in your debt. Thank you for reading this.\n\nMD5: 7dee66f8a89772509bdc32c2fe8b4099\n\nSHA256: fd47be048a18c07d7a7cf3c718ff847be6eed82191e8c8abc70850ca8da5c345",
