I downloaded two android emulators on my laptop to try some mobile games and I noticed that my tabs kept crashing and I was having to restart my computer. Upon inspection of my programs, I saw that I had the malware/virus segurazo which is well known for being an annoying virus that eats up your CPU. You can\u2019t uninstall the program from control panel and you can\u2019t delete the file so you have to install a malware remover like malware bytes. Luckily this worked and I\u2019m free now but I thought people should be aware that you can install stuff like that even through sites that seem legit as \u201cextras\u201d. Be careful everyone!\n[malwarebytes.com](malwarebytes.com)",
