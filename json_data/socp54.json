I assume it would be safe to do so on an Azure Windows 10 VM, but I would rather be safe than sorry.  \n\n\nWould this be a good approach? And/or are there better ways to do this?  \nI am thinking of doing it this way because I wouldn't care if it ruins the system (it probably won't cause it's a phishing attempt) and I (think?) am anonymous. \n\nThanks in advance for your insights!",
