The packer takes 2 sections containing ciphertext, combines them, RC4 decrypts and then decompresses BazarLoader. \n\nThe hash of the sample I'm looking at is: 62a7b273f763f92fd683d9248ae9ab7f5bc115b8c15e995291fdeb91d1aecc4b\n\nHere are some screenshots indicating the RC4 Decryption Routine, the compressed data and the Decompression Routine: https://imgur.com/a/TyiyZeY\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any help in identifying what this is using for decompression so I can finish my unpacker. Thanks!",
