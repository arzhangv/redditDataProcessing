Thought I could sell this tool I co-created, it's called WinElevator, it runs windows apps with admin rights, then those apps can load kernel drivers, good application if you're working with rootkits.\n\nA precompiled, CLI tool is available for $150, and the source for $540. Anyone interested could mail me at tedsimpson114@gmail.com\n",
