This dude never has to give any of it back so he could just rot in prison and his family can keep the BTC forever assuming they would have the credentials to the wallet.  Right?\n\nThere isn\u2019t any bank or central agency so it would have to be moved away from this guy (or whomever) with a valid transaction.  Right?",
