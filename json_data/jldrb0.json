            "comment": "It looks to be a variant of W32/SillyDC worm.  The .INF file probably points to the .EXE to make it execute when AutoRun is enabled on a system.\n\nThe initial infect occurs when the host has AutoRun enabled and an infected drive is connected.  AutoRun executes the instructions in the .INF file to execute the worm; infecting the host.  The worm then infects all USB media plugged into the host.  This will continue until the malware process is killed and the files are deleted.\n\nAVG does a good job with older worms like this.  The screen shot leads me to believe that the worm did not run and infect your system.\n\nThe uTorrent hit looks to be a bundled software package.  Either uTorrent was downloaded from a third party site and the Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) was added or it is a downloader renamed to uTorrent.  If you use uTorrent make sure you download from either source or a known good hosting site.",
