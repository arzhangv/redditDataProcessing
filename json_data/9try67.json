            "comment": "Mine is simplistic, but mostly because i'm just testing the effectiveness of different av products against ransomware samples and inspecting phishing emails. It's a headless optiplex 3020 i5, shoved under some network stuff - running hyper-v with a bunch of win10/win7 vms. It's connected to a Sonicwall with its own restricted zone on a seperate WAN address from all of my other garbage. Really simple and gets the job done. Probably going to replace it with something beefier but smaller in the future.",
