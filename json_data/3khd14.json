Shortly thereafter, I received information about a three-word variant that was followed by a slash and 15 digits.\n\n    GET /correct_horse_battery_staple/123456789012345678\n    GET /horse-battery-staple/123456789012345\n\nThing is, I now can't seem to find any information pertaining to these Angler variants.  I lost the information I was given (months ago) and searching hasn't yielded any results as of yet.\n\nHas anyone else seen something similar?",
