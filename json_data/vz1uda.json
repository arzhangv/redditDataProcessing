When trying to extract the ZIP, windows explorer stopped responding and restarted. I ran a windows defender scan and it found a threat: Tool:AndroidOS/MultiVerze.\n\nIs that a virus or a false positive? I removed it via windows defender, but if it is a virus, is there any chance my computer is still infected?\n\nI would really appreciate any help.",
