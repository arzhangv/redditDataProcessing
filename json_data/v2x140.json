I never seen it doing any nasty stuff in my browser and Microsoft info page doesn't detailed anything about it. Should I quarantine the file (a PDF) or just leave it as is? I don't know how a PDF can harm my computer, neither my browser.",

You could also look into some of the free scanners on BleepingComputer or something for a tool to check if it dropped files elsewhere on the system.",
