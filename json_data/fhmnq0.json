I use Bitdefender and for the past few weeks I keep getting phishing alerts from these websites in particular:\n\nhttp://xml.admidainsight .com/click?i=WoBXnQp\\*fCU\\_0\n\nhttp://xml.hueadsxml .com/click?i=bdaDThr6BFc\\_0\n\nIt happens usually in the evenings and a few alerts in the span of one to two minutes.\n\nSometimes I have the browser open and sometimes I do not.\n\nI tried googling this but I can't come up with a reason as to why this is happening.\n\nWhat's going on?",
