        "selftext": "When I think about un-wanted programs snooping into your internet history files and such, I think of adware programs. They are \"legit\" and they can legally show you ads depending on what you browse for. It makes sense to me anyway, even though I don't agree with it.\n\nI was reading an article (that I can't find again) that malware deployed by cyber criminals steal history and the like, and creates user profiles to sell on the black market. What people would be buying these, and what could they possibly gain? No legitimate companies would every buy from these people, yet I hear they make a bit of dough. \n\nI feel like cyber criminals would take credit card info and banking sites, but creating user profiles from internet history.. that to me seems kinda odd. \n\nHonestly, what would they do? Sell a bunch of IP addresses and the URLs they visit? Who would want that?\n\nI hope this is the place for some enlightenment on the subject.\n\nThanks.",
