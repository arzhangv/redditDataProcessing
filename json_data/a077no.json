Or could it be either one? How would it work exactly? This is excluding man-in-the-middle attacks or when the fraudster tries to manipulate an existing payment. It is relating to when the fraudster logs in to create a brand new payment/recipient. From the bank's perspective, would it look like it is the customer's actual IP/browser OR would it look like it is a brand new log in/data? \n\nI have tried to find this by reading articles regarding banking trojans, but they only state how the compromise/virus would function from an overhead view.\n\nThanks and I appreciate all replies. :)\n\n",
