Can your PC get hijacked by rootkits or malware or whatever - that injects third party ads on your streaming videos? \n\nI am seeing these sam-like ads (\"download driver/update driver, click here for coupons) on youtube. These ads only show up on youtube video player's bottom portion (not the square sized ads on the side). \n\nSeeing these on both chrome and firefox. But I could be over thinking the whole thing. Or not. Can someone clarify the situation? Have I been hijacked?",
