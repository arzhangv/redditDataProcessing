I've tried so many times by sending mails or writing on their skype acc to unsubscribe, unregister, delete but so far that didn't end well. Even I've tried contact with facebook but it seems their official fanpage doesn't exist. Few times I succed contact with skype. Gently I say hi and described the problem. They didn't respond me nor kind neither fast.. After 3rd time of asking to solve the same problem (span of week), I've been started to be ignored.\n\nI created this post because I need help. What to do now?\nI'm sorry if my post was kind of nazi-grammar.\nToday, when I finish my work I can provide some screenshoots with a proof.",
