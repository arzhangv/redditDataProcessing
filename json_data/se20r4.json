            "comment": "It's not that surprising to me. Malware authors will target what's plentiful and easy. Most of these are looking for the low hanging fruit, unpatched exposed IoT devices, default credentials, etc. \n\nLanguages like golang also make cross compilation simple and interpreted languages exist. Linux has only had less malware targeting it as a rule thus far because there are more desktop Windows users. By default, it tends to be a lot more open than Windows. I predict we will only see increasing amounts of Linux targeted malware.",

Linux is already significantly lower risk than Windows.  Maybe a Raspberry Pi with its ARM processor would help reduce risk even further.  Apparently they make a decent desktop for causal use.",
