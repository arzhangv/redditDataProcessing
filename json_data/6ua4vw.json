            "comment": "Absolutely agree. Analysis tools that detect malicious-ness work just fine. This is clearly a malicious document that is heavily detected by AV and other heuristic scanning engines. The point of the article was to show that malware analysts can't always rely on automatic analysis tools (tools specifically designed to analyze binaries/scripts to discover how they work and to reverse engineer their logic, not tools to detect maliciousness). I hope this helps clarify the intent of the article and apologies for any confusion :)",
