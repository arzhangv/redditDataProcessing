Most of the devices cannot have software installed on them, so I think it would need to be from a router/computer. However, I do want the device to actually have Internet connectivity, but I dont want to see anything else happening on the network (other computers, ARPs, etc)\n\nI'm thinking it would have to be a router, connected to the Internet via WAN, the IoT connected via wireless, and a computer with a network card that can go into promiscuous mode and capture everything. Wireshark would have to have filters to restrict traffic from other devices on the network? Thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Posting here because I want to see what might be malicious with these devices.",
