It's not losing them that I'm worried about, none of the decryption tools have been able to help anyways. But should I be worried about the person now having access to passwords, credit card numbers, pictures of my passport/birth cert/SSN/etc, that were among the files encrypted.  \nI believe the ransomware was CryptXXX v1?  \n\n\nI think I removed everything using malwarebytes, except I keep getting a pup from google chrome sync data or something, but that seems to be a common and generally benign problem.  \nI've changed most of my important passwords etc  \nHow worried should I be, and what should I do now.  \nThanks",
