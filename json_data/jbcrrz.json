Scanned the .apk file through virustotal, which came back detecting  and Android.PUA.DebugKey. From what I can see **Android.PUA.DebugKey** isn't a problem, just a false positive that is common in modded apps. However, I don't know what AdLibrary:Generisk is and am wondering if it is safe to run the apk through bluestacks. Any help would be very much appreciated.   \nDisclaimer: I apologise if this isn't the right subreddit however I am not asking for help with malware removal, just general information as to whether it is safe.",
