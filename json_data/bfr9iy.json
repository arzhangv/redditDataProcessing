Then out of nowhere, I heard a short beep. I checked all my open tabs in mozilla to see if anything caused the beep, but there was nothing interesting. A few moments later, the video on youtube was interruped and I heard through my speakers someone saying \"You're more handsome in your photo\".  It caught my attention cause it was a different voice. I checked youtube to see maybe it was a line in the video, but nope. Also no ads open in any of the tabs. I proceeded to cover the laptop camera immediately. WTF just happened? Should I be worried?",
