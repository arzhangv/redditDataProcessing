I have already reported the zip file as well as the payload downloaded by the Windows shortcut within the zip file.\n\nBut, I have been unable to determine how the html file is downloading the ZIP. I don't know how to deobfuscate the javascript. I ran Wireshark to try to capture any DNS queries or IP address from which the file is downloading from but I'm having no luck. Anyone care to take a crack at this and, if you're feeling it, let me know what you found and how you found it?\n\nGoogle Drive zip file download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dEeAcHO5-VvGlj46AUhMwttA85epvDvT/view?usp=sharing).",
