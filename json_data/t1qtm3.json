(Base64 encoding is 5/40 detected, so I had to use another transport-safe encoding scheme) Host program takes that string and reverses it back to bytes and runs the bytes in memory.\n\nIt\u2019s that simple folks, remember to always crosscheck hashes, and do your own analysis on new files.\n\nAny questions are welcome.",
