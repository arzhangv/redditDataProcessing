When I launched it, LittleSnitch alerted me of its attempts to access multiple sites, and more specifically, \"stun.\" subdomains on these sites. \n\nKnowing that Safejumper is opensource, I searched the repository and found the list of sites. \n\nHere's a link to the file containing the list: \nhttps://github.com/proxysh/Safejumper-for-Desktop/blob/master/safejumper/stun.cpp\n\nMy attempts to get answers from the proxy.sh team have been unsuccessful. Can anyone comment on this? Is accessing these a normal behavior for a vpn client?\n\nThank you!",
