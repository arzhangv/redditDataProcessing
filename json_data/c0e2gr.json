When I ran malwarebytes I just gave me a ton of warnings about my electrum wallet, but I found out that was most likely false positive. Now I have uninstalled all but worried my pc is compromissed. Can anyone have a look at the BTC2 core wallet to see if its something fishy?  [https://www.bitc2.org/](https://www.bitc2.org/)",
