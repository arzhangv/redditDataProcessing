You can supply passwords with 7z too. I usually extract everything then just cat all the files and scroll through till I see obfuscated bullshit, reverse it to typically find the stage 2 domain or shell code being loaded into memory. There's alot of different ways to weaponize word docs so you'll have to figure it out. Once extracted running Yara over the extracted files might help Hone in on it too",

I suspect that it is obfuscated and not encrypted, it is much more common with VBA macros. You can try using olevba instead of oledump and see if that helps you see more of what is going on. In the end, deobfuscation is probably going to require a good amount of tedious replacements of variable names and removing junk code.",
