            "comment": "Unfortunately, I do not run ClamAV or any other AV: this is from a WordPress honey pot, a fake WordPress that acts just enough like a real WordPress installation that automated malware downloaders are fooled. I assure you that I am in complete control over the machine in question, it runs Linux, and I do NOT run any kind of anti-virus. I based my analysis on deobfuscating and understanding the PHP downloaded to my honey pot. Nothing actually executed. No files were actually renamed, merely *if* this malware had executed, it might have renamed some files.\n\nThe honey pot includes a WSO web shell emulator. This PHP was downloaded via the WSO emulator. So, to recap, I analyzed PHP source code downloaded to my machine. It did not execute. There is no anti-virus. The PHP downloaded to my machine would have examined every file under DocumentRoot, with a variety of PHP functions. For files that the PHP functions deemed to constitute malware, the \"cleanup\" function would execute, and if it had executed (it did not) it would add a \".suspected\" suffix to the file name. I know this is the behavior of an antivirus. This is not an antivirus. It is malware. It treats a few files, ones that contain Web Shell by oRb source code, differently. Those files get a line or two of PHP added to them:\n\n    if (!isset($_COOKIE['227e948fdbaaeccbbb7b3f42fbe848e8'])) {header('HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found');exit;}\n\nThe name of  the cookie is calculated based on the host name in the URL of the WSO web shell that runs this malware.\n\nThis means that the PHP malware that (mostly) creates files with \".suspected\" suffixes, actually leaves WSO web shell in place, probably with a \".php\" suffix so that it can still execute. However! You still have to have a special cookie when accessessing the WSO instances. So this is not entirely analogous to anti-virus. It would be as if the anti-virus left a few suspicious files around for the companies' use later.\n\nIn fact, quite a few HTTP request made of my honey pot have a cookie named as per above. That is, the people who run this malware probably use the WSO instances they find themselves, while keeping out every other cybercriminal that doesn't know the cookie.\n\nBecause this is downloaded to a WSO web shell, and would ordinarily be immediately executed by that web shell, it's malware that's not often caught or analyzed. Its existence explains a lot of the reports of mysterious \".suspected\" suffixes on machines that don't (that is DO NOT) run an antivirus. Those machines are compromised, have a WSO instance, and these attackers send PHP to the WSO instance that renames files so that they have the entire compromised machine to themselves.",
