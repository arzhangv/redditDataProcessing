I apologize for making the post too dramatic for you, but I was in desperation because, I legitimately could find very few examples of my problem and I thought it was a rarity.\n\nThat being said, I think I will do a clean wipe of my PC, I planned it earlier, but hesitated due to uncertainty of the repercussions of such actions, but I did take the time to backup my important files, so I think I'll just do that",

There are even automated programs to make any file mostly undetectable now. That's why anyone serious in security knows that anti-virus and anti-malware is mostly useless except for low effort or old programs. \n\n\n&gt;i say rare because it's not a problem i commonly hear,\n\nIt happens a lot, especially when opening e-mail attachments or running sketchy .exe files. The attacker either keylogs you and plays with your accounts, takes control via remote desktop, or adds your PC to their botnet.  \n\nThere's really nothing interesting about this. You should just do a total PC wipe and re-install. \n\nIf you're *actually* dedicated, you could trace down whatever process is running on your computer and grab the .exe file as well as any additional files it has and package them up so someone can have a look at them, as well as possibly submit it to an antivirus database.
