The service name was \"svchost\", and the filename was \"svchost.exs\", dumped into C:\\WINNT\\System32\\. Clearly he was trying to hide it, based on the name and location.\n\nIt looks like it was compiled with something called [WinBatch](http://winbatch.com/).\n\nAnyone have an idea what this does?  I'm assuming it'd need decompiled in some way, as it apparently ends up as compiled C, and from what I've found on Google, [it can't easily be decompiled](http://techsupt.winbatch.com/webcgi/webbatch.exe?techsupt/tsleft.web+winbatch/Compiler+Decompile~a~Compiled~WB~EXE.txt).\n\n* https://malwr.com/analysis/YmQ1M2YwNjRjMTM1NDY4NThhM2Q4ODE3MmE0ODNmZWI/\n* https://virusscan.jotti.org/en-US/filescanjob/pgauuinppq\n* https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/020cb0ed2cf6b3d88ccec53f7d8b7d7893700ddd0f7721896e5fd5cf16927182/analysis/1447530014/\n\nIt looks like malwr will allow you to redownload the file, but if anyone would rather I upload it somewhere, just let me know where you'd like it (or I can send it via email).\n\n**EDIT:**  I updated the malwr link with a version that has the file shared properly, sorry about that!\n\n**EDIT 2:**  Some people have run into a missing DLL error, so I've grabbed the DLL in question, and a few other s that looked similar.
