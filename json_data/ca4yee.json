Many times it\u2019s because ransomware will look for a file or registry related to itself and halt installation if it detects it so that the machine can\u2019t be infected multiple times. That way the machine will stay up and \u201chappy\u201d so the end user can pay rather than possibly being taken down by all the competition for resources and conflicts between multiple infections and encryption runs.",
