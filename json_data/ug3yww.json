I analized it and it turns out it puts itself into your startup folder and spams you (so fast sometimes can crash) with meme alerts. Context shows this was a meme and wasn't trying to be destructive. If you wondered how I did this, and who, I do have answers. This was made by one of my friends, as it was purposefully emailed to me from a spam Discord that I use to talk to my friends. I just wanted to help document this as I think it was interesting\n\n[Link shared](https://anonfiles.com/h6eah3c3y9/Valkyria_exe)",
