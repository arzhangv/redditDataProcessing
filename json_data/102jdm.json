I should also mention that I am not very good with Linux. Would appreciate if anyone could help me out with this..\n\nEdit: I am able to get it to work sometimes, without changing anything, and sometimes it doesn't work. Not able to figure out why it is so temperamental,\n\nEdit2: Figured out the problem. Timezone. Issue fixed and the script is working as it should.",
