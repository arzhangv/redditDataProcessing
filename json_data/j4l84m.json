Everything is good and beautiful, I said it's nothing serious, after the restart it goes, I played about 5/6 hours on the pc / I did my daily activities (watching yt, etc), after I played all of a sudden someone pressed another + tab and shut me out of lawsuits while I was playing. (I mean I actually saw not having my hand on the mouse immediately after I saw another + tab that the mouse was closing my applications -&gt; Steam closed / the game / other applications started. The strange phase is that I only surf on facebook / youtube / reddit / softpedia every day (rarely softpedia) and I don't download fools to download. (all games and applicable are original and licensed). I use Malwarebytes premium as protection. (which did not detect anything).",
