I have removed most of it, but this one piece of adware still lingers.\nWhen I switch tab to Chrome, I am redirected in a new tab to some dodgy websites, pop-ups, porn sites, etc.\nI have tried:\n- Scanning with Malwarebytes and removing anything detected\n- Scanning with AVG and removing anything detected\n- Scanning with adwcleaner and removing anything detected\n- Checking through recently installed programs\n- Checking through system tasks\n- Checking through the registry\n- Checking processes in Task Manager\n\nCould anyone help me with this?",
