I want to find a solution to a problem that malware analysts are having and need urgent attention. I would also like details on what has previously been done in preventing this problem. I then want to write a research about the solution to the problem. If there is any prerequisites that are not covered in practical malware analysis(book) please list them below.\n\nEDIT: I want to write a research paper to enter in the ISEF (Intel science fair competition) my topic will be malware.
