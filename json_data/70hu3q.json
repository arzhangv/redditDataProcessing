I think Talos has FIRST which may be cool but I haven't bought IDA PRO to use this plugin. I am usually just happy to attribute it to a particular malware family variant lol. \n\nOne thing I do, without letting it beacon out, is configure my VM to use another VM (REMnux) to be my DNS, and on REMnux I'll use a plethora of tools to mimick it being a C2. Sometimes you can issue the appropriate responses to see how it interacts with the C2. Or there is a .conf file where you can see the commands it expects. ",
