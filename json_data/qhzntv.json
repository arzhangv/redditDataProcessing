After that, I remove the virus and format my all drive and install fresh windows. then I run anti-virus and do not get any viruses.\n\nI also checked recent activity on my Gmail account and found a login from a remote IP address and believe this is associated with the hacker. I lived in India but the location shows Ukraine. \n\nI changed my Gmail account password, remove all devices from my Gmail. Whenever I log in to Gmail on my pc it's showing different locations. When I log with a different Gmail account it does not show shows Ukraine. how can I resolve it?",
