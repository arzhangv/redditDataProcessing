I've used VirtualBox for a while now, but i would like to get a bit better performance and i've read VMware seems to be a bit better?\n\n\nHaven't tested it yet, maybe you guys can help me up a bit?\n\n\nVbox runs fine, but VMware seems to be perform a bit better under Windows?\n\n\nOr would you alternatively install Linux on a partition, install vbox on linux and do it there?\n\n\nThanks.",
