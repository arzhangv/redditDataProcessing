My mother-in-law called me this evening, saying that last week, as her laptop had gotten more and more sluggish, suddenly her entire screen went to white, and she was faced with an error message saying that her system was in a critical state, and she needed to call Yay Services at 8778260572 for help.  \n\nShe did, and was told she needed to pay $169 to have her machine remotely repaired (scrubbing registry, removing malware, ec.).  She paid, and presumably the issues were resolved and she went on her very unhappy way.\n\nShe called this evening wondering if the whole thing was a scam, and I have to admit, it certainly seems fishy.  I called the number, and reached what sounded like a standard call center, and the rep told me that helpyay.com is a contracted by Microsoft to provide customer service in extreme circumstances, using logmein to gain remote access to people machines and fix things up.\n\nDoes anyone know if this is true?  \n\nAgain, any help would be *hugely* appreciated, even if it's just to point me to a better forum to ask the question.  Thanks! :)",
