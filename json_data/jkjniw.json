Others said it still caused the game to crash but the youtuber offered help. He didnt provide any of the files. He provided links from where he got them from or links to direct install. It was kinda sus also cuz one guy said he found a virus when he put it into virustotal, but i think it was an .exe file which i checked to see if he was right which he wasnt.
