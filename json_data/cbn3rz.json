Got adblock on and all that and going to that link again nothing happens. Any idea why is that? It tells me I'm using an outdated Chrome version. Obviously I have my doubts and I'm not falling into this trap if it is one which I'm 95% sure it is some junk.\n\nEven Chrome marks it as insecure [http://prntscr.com/odby7j](http://prntscr.com/odby7j) and the download link contains BSO in it so do they host the download? Is this a suspicious site even though Chrome marks it as secure? As far as I am aware I've got no viruses on my PC as of now and I've got one more extention that gives me permission to generate steam accounts (it's on one single site). I don't really think it's actually malware just something to get me to install junk on my PC and I think this is the right sub.",
