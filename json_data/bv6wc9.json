This type of thing should be reduced to 1 library per OS maximum. Thid suggests to me that many of the features in this malware are likely libraries that already exist, leading me to believe the authors do not have many resources/time at their disposal.",

Generally this is to support functionality that cant be done purely in Java (i.e. keylogging). Im not sure if thats whats being done here, but if so I wouldnt really consider it 'bloat'.",
