I know that in order to retrieve a dynamic analysis of potential malware one must throw the file at a sandbox and log the activity. \n\nIs using the [online version of Anubis](http://anubis.iseclab.org/) a good place to start?  \n\nOr will I need to run a sandbox locally? I tried QEMU for virtualization and Zero Wine for the environment + behavior logging....but the result was me having a ton of logs without knowing what they meant. \n\nEDIT: While I've discovered that malware behavioral analysis tools like Cuckoo will provide a log of system calls, I'm looking for a more complete picture given by a System Dependence Graph as shown here: http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/ResearchProjects/MalwareAnalysis\n\nThe sample SDGs created in the link above were made with WUSSTrace, an application that I haven't been able to compile. The author also made Qtrace (a plugin from QEMU) but I've been having a difficult time getting that working as well. ",
