From here you can download the file and analyze it on test machine: [https://app.any.run/tasks/9cfc028c-9a6f-46c3-8bab-8338ab3ffac9/#](https://app.any.run/tasks/9cfc028c-9a6f-46c3-8bab-8338ab3ffac9/#)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's interesting is there is a pcap file when this file is run and it appears to communicate to a server called [vb0x.hopto.org](https://vb0x.hopto.org) over port 80. You can see the infected machine sending information about the host to the server such as OS, username, CPU speed, public IP address. Just some information about it. So how did you run into this file?",
