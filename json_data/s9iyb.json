I asked for her number and she told me 718 618 4749.\n\nI played along and she instructed me to open the computer management console.  This account does not have administrative rights so she asked me to close the console and press the windows key.  I told her my keyboard does not have a windows key and she hung up on me.\n\nI didn't get to see much of what she was trying to do. I'm also not sure how she got this number. I wish I had been able to get more information, for example the name of any product she's ultimately trying to sell but she hung up too quickly.",
