Cant figure out how i can deobuscate this one in JS and the string is too long to do that in C++.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe source is here if someone would not mind giving me a hand\n\n[https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/tree/main)",
