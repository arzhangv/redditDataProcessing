The article is really interesting and it looked like some image based steganography was used to hide C2 commands in images obtained from Twitter.\n\n[here](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/memes-on-twitter-used-to-communicate-with-malware/d/d-id/1333518?_mc=rss_x_drr_edt_aud_dr_x_x-rss-simple)\n\nI did some digging though, and [this article](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cybercriminals-use-malicious-memes-that-communicate-with-malware/) seems to be the initial trend micro analysis with assorted hashes at the bottom if anyone is interested",

The commands issued to the malware you're ***already*** infected with, from some other source, is embedded in the meme document.\n\nThis is probably no more than a tech experiment and of little real-world use as they would first have to infect your machine somewhere else and then either force you to visit the Twitter account (giving away the game) or *coerce* you into visiting the account somehow.",
