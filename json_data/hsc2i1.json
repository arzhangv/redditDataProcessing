        "selftext": "Hi all. As the title suggests, I'm looking for an old variant of the LovGate mass emailing worm from 2003-2004. I tracked down an MD5 for the file in question; 42ab20ee5f4757a44edff753bc508840 but I haven't been able to find any hits on VirusShare, AnyRun or VX Vault. I reckon this is down to the age of the malware. I can't afford a VirusTotal Intelligence package even though they have the file I need. I am a malware analyst by trade but I cannot remove samples from the office for obvious reasons. Any help would be appreciated.",
