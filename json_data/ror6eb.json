I think I may have accidentally clicked on a pop up ad a couple of days ago which led me to a suspicious looking url, I closed the page before it completely loaded but that may have caused this. My apps are suddenly acting really strange too. I\u2019ve cleared my cache and added an Apple ID recovery key just in case. If anyone can help that would be much appreciated lol.",
