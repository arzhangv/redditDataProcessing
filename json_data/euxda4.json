I'd love to get my hands on some for a potential research project.\n\nI have tried looking around malshare, virusshare, vx-underground etc. and found some samples but didn't look too much into their cryptographic security.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

You could try and figure out what packer it's using then just use a tool to get a clean binary. Or use a debuger to stop execution after the binary unpacks its self, tho thats not guaranteed as it could try a few ways of preventing debugging. Those are generally the first steps of reversing malware tho theres more to it",
