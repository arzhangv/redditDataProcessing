I believe we got them all stopped, but we scanned them with Symantec and Malwarebytes after the fact and didn't find anything.  Reading this site [https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ransom_locky.jk](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/ransom_locky.jk) it says that the virus self-deletes afterwards.  I checked the registry and the random key was there and I removed it.  I didn't find any \"Locky\" keys at all.  As far as I can tell the infection is gone.  How safe are the PCs?",
