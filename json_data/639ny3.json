The site's DNS records looks like they are hosted by hxxp://websitewelcome.com, which according to google is a bit dodgy.\n\nAfter WGET'ing some pages from the site and reading through the JS, the site doesn't looks like some EK delivery, just a simple phishing place that's not trying very hard either.\n\nI've sent the guy who sent me the email an email telling him to verify the previous email (will also call tomorrow), but what else can I do so that the phishing site can die a horrible death?\n\nCheers!",
